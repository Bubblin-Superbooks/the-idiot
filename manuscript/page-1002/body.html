Not a word about you, prince, the whole time! The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling with her people about Gania.

I heard it from Varia herself&mdash;Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite, but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them nothing about it, and they didn&rsquo;t know they were saying goodbye for the last time.</p></div> </div>
