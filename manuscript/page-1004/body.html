What hopes?&rdquo; cried Colia; &ldquo;you surely don&rsquo;t mean Aglaya?&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dreadful sceptic, prince,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;I have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about everything. You don&rsquo;t seem to believe in people as you did, and are always attributing motives and so on&mdash;am I using the word &lsquo;sceptic&rsquo; in its proper sense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe so; but I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll change it, right or wrong; I&rsquo;ll say that you are not sceptical, but jealous. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania, over a certain proud damsel! Come!&rdquo; Colia jumped up, with these words, and burst out laughing.</p></div> </div>
