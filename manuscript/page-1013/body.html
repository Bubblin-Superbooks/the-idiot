<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now then, did you, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so ago, about Easter-tide?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What for? What was your object? Show me the letter.&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s eyes flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience.</p><p>&ldquo;I have not got the letter,&rdquo; said the prince, timidly, extremely surprised at the turn the conversation had taken. &ldquo;If anyone has it, if it still exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No finessing, please. What did you write about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you; but I don&rsquo;t see the slightest reason why I should not have written.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
