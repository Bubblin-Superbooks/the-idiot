<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, you can talk afterwards! What was the letter about? Why are you blushing?&rdquo;</p><p>The prince was silent. At last he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see that the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you. You must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your questions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of the letter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least inclined to blush about it&rdquo; (here the prince&rsquo;s blushes redoubled), &ldquo;I will repeat the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by heart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
