Why, she called you an &lsquo;idiot&rsquo; herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you might have spared me that,&rdquo; murmured the prince reproachfully, almost in a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl. If she likes a person she will pitch into him, and chaff him. I used to be just such another. But for all that you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself, my boy; she is not for you. I don&rsquo;t believe it, and it is not to be. I tell you so at once, so that you may take proper precautions. Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
