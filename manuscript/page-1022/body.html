<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were worth it). Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for you, my friend, not for you, don&rsquo;t flatter yourself! I have my own grief, always the same, always the same. But I&rsquo;ll tell you why I have been awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence itself sent you to be a friend and a brother to me. I haven&rsquo;t a friend in the world except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid as a sheep from old age. Now then, tell me, yes or no? Do you know why she called out from her carriage the other night?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
