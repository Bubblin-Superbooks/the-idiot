<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter and know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well, I believe you. I have my own ideas about it. Up to yesterday morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to blame; now I cannot help agreeing with the others. But why he was made such a fool of I cannot understand. However, he is not going to marry Aglaya, I can tell you that. He may be a very excellent fellow, but&mdash;so it shall be. I was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I have quite made up my mind that I won&rsquo;t have him. &lsquo;Put me in my coffin first and then into my grave, and then you may marry my daughter to whomsoever you please,&rsquo; so I said to the general this very morning. You see how I trust you, my boy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
