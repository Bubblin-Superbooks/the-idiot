<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s a most improper note, I call it; most improper for such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. H&rsquo;m! I dare say she was annoyed that you didn&rsquo;t come; but she ought to have known that one can&rsquo;t write like that to an idiot like you, for you&rsquo;d be sure to take it literally.&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her all the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. &ldquo;What are you listening for?&rdquo; she added, seeing that she had committed herself a little. &ldquo;She wants a clown like you&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t seen one for some time&mdash;to play with. That&rsquo;s why she is anxious for you to come to the house. And right glad I am that she&rsquo;ll make a thorough good fool of you. You deserve it; and she can do it&mdash;oh! she can, indeed!&mdash;as well as most people.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
