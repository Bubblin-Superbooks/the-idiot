They were not quite certain, but had at times a strong suspicion that things did not happen to them as they did to other people.

Other houses were governed by a timid routine; theirs was somehow different. Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna was alone in making these fretful observations; the girls, though not wanting in intelligence, were still young; the general was intelligent, too, but narrow, and in any difficulty he was content to say, &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; and leave the matter to his wife. Consequently, on her fell the responsibility.</p></div> </div>
