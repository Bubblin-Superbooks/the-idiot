She was twenty-five now, and must be fated to be an old maid, and &ldquo;with such beauty, too!&rdquo; The mother spent whole nights in weeping and lamenting, while all the time the cause of her grief slumbered peacefully. &ldquo;What is the matter with her?

She set a high value on Alexandra Ivanovna&rsquo;s judgment, and often consulted her in difficulties; but that she was a &lsquo;wet hen&rsquo; she never for a moment doubted. &ldquo;She is so calm; nothing rouses her&mdash;though wet hens are not always calm!
