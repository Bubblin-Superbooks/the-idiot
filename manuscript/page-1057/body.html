Liberalism is not a sin, it is a necessary part of a great whole, which whole would collapse and fall to pieces without it. Liberalism has just as much right to exist as has the most moral conservatism; but I am attacking Russian liberalism; and I attack it for the simple reason that a Russian liberal is not a Russian liberal, he is a non-Russian liberal. Show me a real Russian liberal, and I&rsquo;ll kiss him before you all, with pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he cared to kiss you, that is,&rdquo; said Alexandra, whose cheeks were red with irritation and excitement.</p></div> </div>
