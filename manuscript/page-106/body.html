It may be this very evening,&rdquo; remarked Gania to the general, with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know the kind of person she is at times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How? What kind of person is she?&rdquo; cried the general, arrived at the limits of his patience. &ldquo;Look here, Gania, don&rsquo;t you go annoying her tonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way the question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk.</p></div> </div>
