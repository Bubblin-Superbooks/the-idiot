<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I am not a great authority on literary questions, but I certainly do hold that Russian literature is not Russian, except perhaps Lomonosoff, Pouschkin and Gogol.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, that is a considerable admission, and in the second place, one of the above was a peasant, and the other two were both landed proprietors!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite so, but don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry! For since it has been the part of these three men, and only these three, to say something absolutely their own, not borrowed, so by this very fact these three men become really national. If any Russian shall have done or said anything really and absolutely original, he is to be called national from that moment, though he may not be able to talk the Russian language; still he is a national Russian. I consider that an axiom. But we were not speaking of literature; we began by discussing the socialists.</p></div> </div>
