At all events, no other has ever said or written a word about it; and in this fact is expressed the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort which I am now considering.</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an attack (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon the existing order of things? Is this so? Yes. Very well. Then my &lsquo;fact&rsquo; consists in this, that Russian liberalism is not an attack upon the existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence of things themselves&mdash;indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on the Russian order of things, but on Russia itself. My Russian liberal goes so far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own mother.</p></div> </div>
