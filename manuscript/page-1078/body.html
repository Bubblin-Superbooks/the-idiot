It&rsquo;s just like him,&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, boiling over once more, and entirely oblivious of the fact that she had just taken the prince&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;I dare swear that you went up to town yesterday on purpose to get the little wretch to do you the great honour of coming to stay at your house. You did go up to town, you know you did&mdash;you said so yourself! Now then, did you, or did you not, go down on your knees and beg him to come, confess!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, for I saw it all myself,&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;On the contrary, Hippolyte kissed his hand twice and thanked him; and all the prince said was that he thought Hippolyte might feel better here in the country!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
