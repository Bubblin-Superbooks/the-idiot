He is very happy to be here; but I think perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,&mdash;he is very sensitive now that he is so ill&mdash;and he might be embarrassed if you show him too much attention at first. He is decidedly better today, and says he has not felt so well for the last six months, and has coughed much less, too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
