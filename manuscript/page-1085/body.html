Be assured of that.&rdquo;</p><p>Evgenie Pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment. For one moment it was all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing; but, looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be quite himself; at all events, he was in a very curious state.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting, prince,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that you did not in the least mean to say that, and very likely you meant to address someone else altogether. What is it? Are you feeling unwell or anything?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
