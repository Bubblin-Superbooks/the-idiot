Do his fits begin like that?&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna, in a high state of alarm, addressing Colia.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Lizabetha Prokofievna, take no notice of me. I am not going to have a fit. I will go away directly; but I know I am afflicted. I was twenty-four years an invalid, you see&mdash;the first twenty-four years of my life&mdash;so take all I do and say as the sayings and actions of an invalid. I&rsquo;m going away directly, I really am&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid. I am not blushing, for I don&rsquo;t think I need blush about it, need I? But I see that I am out of place in society&mdash;society is better without me. It&rsquo;s not vanity, I assure you. I have thought over it all these last three days, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself candidly before you at the first opportunity.</p></div> </div>
