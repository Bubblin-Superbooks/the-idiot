<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some wicked person has been maligning me to you; but it&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, the prince approached Aglaya.</p><p>She took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took in what he had said, and burst out laughing&mdash;such a merry, unrestrained laugh, so hearty and gay, that Adelaida could not contain herself. She, too, glanced at the prince&rsquo;s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a fit of laughter as Aglaya&rsquo;s own. They laughed together like a couple of school-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed &ldquo;Well, thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
