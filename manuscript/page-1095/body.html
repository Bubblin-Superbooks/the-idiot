<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mother, dear, I may kiss him, mayn&rsquo;t I? Aglaya, may I kiss your prince?&rdquo; cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up to the prince and kissed his forehead.</p><p>He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly cried out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her right hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.</p><p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;Prince, you must walk with me. May he, mother? This young cavalier, who won&rsquo;t have me? You said you would never have me, didn&rsquo;t you, prince? No&mdash;no, not like that; that&rsquo;s not the way to give your arm. Don&rsquo;t you know how to give your arm to a lady yet? There&mdash;so. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would you like to lead the way with me alone, tête-à-tête?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
