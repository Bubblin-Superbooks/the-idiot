I asked some officer about this afterwards, and he said it was perfectly true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is probably when they fire from a long distance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you shoot at all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I have never shot in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even load a pistol?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!
