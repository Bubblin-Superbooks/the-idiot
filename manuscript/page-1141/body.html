<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The general shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;How strange everyone, yourself included, has become of late,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was telling you that I cannot in the least understand Lizabetha Prokofievna&rsquo;s ideas and agitations. She is in hysterics up there, and moans and says that we have been &lsquo;shamed and disgraced.&rsquo; How? Why? When? By whom? I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not conceal the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this woman, must really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary, and I am just on my way now to talk the question over and make some arrangements. It can all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly, and without the slightest fuss or scandal. I foresee that the future is pregnant with events, and that there is much that needs explanation.</p></div> </div>
