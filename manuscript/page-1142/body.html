If I have heard nothing about it, nor have you, nor he, nor she&mdash;who has heard about it, I should like to know?

But now I see that their opinion is more correct. I do not believe in the theory of madness! The woman has no common sense; but she is not only not insane, she is artful to a degree. Her outburst of this evening about Evgenie&rsquo;s uncle proves that conclusively. It was villainous, simply jesuitical, and it was all for some special purpose.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
