<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I tell you, my dear fellow, Aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a self-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it! Every high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be found in her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild fancies&mdash;indeed, a little devil! She has just been laughing at her mother to her very face, and at her sisters, and at Prince S., and everybody&mdash;and of course she always laughs at me! You know I love the child&mdash;I love her even when she laughs at me, and I believe the wild little creature has a special fondness for me for that very reason. She is fonder of me than any of the others. I dare swear she has had a good laugh at you before now! You were having a quiet talk just now, I observed, after all the thunder and lightning upstairs. She was sitting with you just as though there had been no row at all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
