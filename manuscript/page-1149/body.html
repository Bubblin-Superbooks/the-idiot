She would not give the slightest explanation; she burst out laughing, banged the door, and went away. We all stood there with our mouths open.

She is enjoying herself like a child, at your expense, and therefore, since she is a child, don&rsquo;t be angry with her, and don&rsquo;t think anything of it. I assure you, she is simply making a fool of you, just as she does with one and all of us out of pure lack of something better to do.</p></div> </div>
