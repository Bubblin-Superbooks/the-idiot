<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, prince, here is Keller, absolutely at your service&mdash;command him!&mdash;ready to sacrifice himself&mdash;even to die in case of need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, why?&mdash;Of course you&rsquo;ll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant Moloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he won&rsquo;t pass an insult. He will take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the only one left to account for. You&rsquo;ll have to pay the piper, prince. He has been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you tomorrow&mdash;perhaps he is at your house already. If you would do me the honour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy. That&rsquo;s why I have been looking for you now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
