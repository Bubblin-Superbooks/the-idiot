He laughed unrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a fever of excitement to offer himself as &ldquo;second,&rdquo; was very near being offended.</p><p>&ldquo;You caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride can stand that sort of treatment in public.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,&rdquo; cried the prince, still laughing. &ldquo;What are we to fight about? I shall beg his pardon, that&rsquo;s all. But if we must fight&mdash;we&rsquo;ll fight! Let him have a shot at me, by all means; I should rather like it.</p></div> </div>
