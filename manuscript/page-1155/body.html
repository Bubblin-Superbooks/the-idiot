<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ha, ha, ha! I know how to load a pistol now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller? First, you have to buy the powder, you know; it mustn&rsquo;t be wet, and it mustn&rsquo;t be that coarse stuff that they load cannons with&mdash;it must be pistol powder. Then you pour the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some door, and then shove the bullet in. But don&rsquo;t shove the bullet in before the powder, because the thing wouldn&rsquo;t go off&mdash;do you hear, Keller, the thing wouldn&rsquo;t go off! Ha, ha, ha! Isn&rsquo;t that a grand reason, Keller, my friend, eh? Do you know, my dear fellow, I really must kiss you, and embrace you, this very moment. Ha, ha! How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did? Come to my house as soon as you can, and we&rsquo;ll have some champagne.</p></div> </div>
