<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary man you are! I wonder at you!&rdquo; Rogojin laughed sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you hate me so?&rdquo; asked the prince, sadly. &ldquo;You know yourself that all you suspected is quite unfounded. I felt you were still angry with me, though. Do you know why? Because you tried to kill me&mdash;that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t shake off your wrath against me. I tell you that I only remember the Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed brotherhood. I wrote you this in yesterday&rsquo;s letter, in order that you might forget all that madness on your part, and that you might not feel called to talk about it when we met. Why do you avoid me? Why do you hold your hand back from me? I tell you again, I consider all that has passed a delirium, an insane dream. I can understand all you did, and all you felt that day, as if it were myself.</p></div> </div>
