Of course I believe every word you say, and I know perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in any way, and yet, I don&rsquo;t love you.

What do you know about my feelings, eh?&rdquo; (Rogojin laughed disagreeably.) &ldquo;Here you are holding out your brotherly forgiveness to me for a thing that I have perhaps never repented of in the slightest degree. I did not think of it again all that evening; all my thoughts were centred on something else&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
