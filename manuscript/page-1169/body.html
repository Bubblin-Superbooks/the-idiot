<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Not think of it again? Of course you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;And I dare swear that you came straight away down here to Pavlofsk to listen to the music and dog her about in the crowd, and stare at her, just as you did today. There&rsquo;s nothing surprising in that! If you hadn&rsquo;t been in that condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one subject, you would, probably, never have raised your knife against me. I had a presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw you first in the morning. Do you know yourself what you looked like? I knew you would try to murder me even at the very moment when we exchanged crosses. What did you take me to your mother for? Did you think to stay your hand by doing so? Perhaps you did not put your thoughts into words, but you and I were thinking the same thing, or feeling the same thing looming over us, at the same moment.</p></div> </div>
