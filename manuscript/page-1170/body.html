<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What should you think of me now if you had not raised your knife to me&mdash;the knife which God averted from my throat? I would have been guilty of suspecting you all the same&mdash;and you would have intended the murder all the same; therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case. Come, don&rsquo;t frown; you needn&rsquo;t laugh at me, either. You say you haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;repented.&rsquo; Repented! You probably couldn&rsquo;t, if you were to try; you dislike me too much for that. Why, if I were an angel of light, and as innocent before you as a babe, you would still loathe me if you believed that she loved me, instead of loving yourself. That&rsquo;s jealousy&mdash;that is the real jealousy.</p></div> </div>
