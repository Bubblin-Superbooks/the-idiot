<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But do you know what I have been thinking out during this last week, Parfen? I&rsquo;ll tell you. What if she loves you now better than anyone? And what if she torments you because she loves you, and in proportion to her love for you, so she torments you the more? She won&rsquo;t tell you this, of course; you must have eyes to see. Why do you suppose she consents to marry you? She must have a reason, and that reason she will tell you some day. Some women desire the kind of love you give her, and she is probably one of these. Your love and your wild nature impress her. Do you know that a woman is capable of driving a man crazy almost, with her cruelties and mockeries, and feels not one single pang of regret, because she looks at him and says to herself, &lsquo;There! I&rsquo;ll torment this man nearly into his grave, and then, oh! how I&rsquo;ll compensate him for it all with my love!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
