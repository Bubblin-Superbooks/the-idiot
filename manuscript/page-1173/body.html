<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you in the least, Parfen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she told me all about it long ago, and tonight I saw for myself. I saw you at the music, you know, and whom you were sitting with. She swore to me yesterday, and again today, that you are madly in love with Aglaya Ivanovna. But that&rsquo;s all the same to me, prince, and it&rsquo;s not my affair at all; for if you have ceased to love her, she has not ceased to love you. You know, of course, that she wants to marry you to that girl? She&rsquo;s sworn to it! Ha, ha! She says to me, &lsquo;Until then I won&rsquo;t marry you. When they go to church, we&rsquo;ll go too&mdash;and not before.&rsquo; What on earth does she mean by it? I don&rsquo;t know, and I never did.</p></div> </div>
