She says, &lsquo;I want to see him happy,&rsquo; which is to say&mdash;she loves you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right mind,&rdquo; said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin said.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodness knows&mdash;you may be wrong there! At all events, she named the day this evening, as we left the gardens. &lsquo;In three weeks,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and perhaps sooner, we shall be married.&rsquo; She swore to it, took off her cross and kissed it.
