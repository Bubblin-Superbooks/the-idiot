<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; began the prince; &ldquo;and since you are so very kind there is just one matter which I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must really excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted the general, &ldquo;but I positively haven&rsquo;t another moment now. I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about you, and if she wishes to receive you at once&mdash;as I shall advise her&mdash;I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways.

We mustn&rsquo;t forget to finish off that matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
