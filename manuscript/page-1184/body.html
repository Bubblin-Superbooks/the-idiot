Say &lsquo;how do you do&rsquo; to the others, and come and sit down here, quick&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you!&rdquo; he added, accentuating the fact that he had waited. On the prince&rsquo;s asking, &ldquo;Will it not be injurious to you to sit out so late?&rdquo; he replied that he could not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so ago, for he never had felt better than this evening.</p></div> </div>
