There are gentry present who are a little too much interested in us. You are not aware of that perhaps, prince? It will be a great deal better if they see that we are friendly just in an ordinary way. They&rsquo;ll all go in a couple of hours, and then I&rsquo;ll ask you to give me twenty minutes&mdash;half an hour at most.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By all means! I assure you I am delighted&mdash;you need not have entered into all these explanations. As for your remarks about friendship with me&mdash;thanks, very much indeed. You must excuse my being a little absent this evening. Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything just now?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
