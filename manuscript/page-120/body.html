He seemed to have some special object in the question.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful face,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t she? Her eyes show it&mdash;those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins. It&rsquo;s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
