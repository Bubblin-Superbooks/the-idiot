<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction are equally powerful in this world. The devil will hold his empire over humanity until a limit of time which is still unknown. You laugh? You do not believe in the devil? Scepticism as to the devil is a French idea, and it is also a frivolous idea. Do you know who the devil is? Do you know his name? Although you don&rsquo;t know his name you make a mockery of his form, following the example of Voltaire. You sneer at his hoofs, at his tail, at his horns&mdash;all of them the produce of your imagination! In reality the devil is a great and terrible spirit, with neither hoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you who have endowed him with these attributes! But... he is not the question just now!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
