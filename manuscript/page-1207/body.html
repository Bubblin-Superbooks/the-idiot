<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As for me, I don&rsquo;t believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity. For, founded on no moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying bread to humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity from enjoying it; that has been seen more than once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, these waggons may coldly exclude?&rdquo; repeated someone.</p><p>&ldquo;That has been seen already,&rdquo; continued Lebedeff, not deigning to notice the interruption. &ldquo;Malthus was a friend of humanity, but, with ill-founded moral principles, the friend of humanity is the devourer of humanity, without mentioning his pride; for, touch the vanity of one of these numberless philanthropists, and to avenge his self-esteem, he will be ready at once to set fire to the whole globe; and to tell the truth, we are all more or less like that. I, perhaps, might be the first to set a light to the fuel, and then run away. But, again, I must repeat, that is not the question.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
