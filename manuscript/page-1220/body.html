<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I might say, perhaps, in our century of steamboats and railways, but I repeat in our century of vices and railways, because I am drunk but truthful! Show me a single idea which unites men nowadays with half the strength that it had in those centuries, and dare to maintain that the &lsquo;springs of life&rsquo; have not been polluted and weakened beneath this &lsquo;star,&rsquo; beneath this network in which men are entangled! Don&rsquo;t talk to me about your prosperity, your riches, the rarity of famine, the rapidity of the means of transport! There is more of riches, but less of force. The idea uniting heart and soul to heart and soul exists no more. All is loose, soft, limp&mdash;we are all of us limp.... Enough, gentlemen! I have done. That is not the question.</p></div> </div>
