I believe I&rsquo;m half asleep. I&rsquo;ve had such a dreadful dream&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only just remembered it. Prince, I don&rsquo;t wish you such dreams as that, though sure enough, perhaps, I don&rsquo;t love you. Why wish a man evil, though you do not love him, eh? Give me your hand&mdash;let me press it sincerely. There&mdash;you&rsquo;ve given me your hand&mdash;you must feel that I do press it sincerely, don&rsquo;t you? I don&rsquo;t think I shall drink any more. What time is it? Never mind, I know the time. The time has come, at all events. What! they are laying supper over there, are they? Then this table is free? Capital, gentlemen! I&mdash;hem! these gentlemen are not listening.</p></div> </div>
