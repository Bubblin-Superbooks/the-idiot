Confess it was you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last week? In the night? Have you gone cracked, my good friend?&rdquo;</p><p>Hippolyte paused and considered a moment. Then a smile of cunning&mdash;almost triumph&mdash;crossed his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; he murmured, almost in a whisper, but with absolute conviction. &ldquo;Yes, it was you who came to my room and sat silently on a chair at my window for a whole hour&mdash;more! It was between one and two at night; you rose and went out at about three. It was you, you! Why you should have frightened me so, why you should have wished to torment me like that, I cannot tell&mdash;but you it was.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
