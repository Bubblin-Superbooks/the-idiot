<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is my &lsquo;last and solemn&rsquo;&mdash;but why need I call it that? There is no question about the truth of it, for it is not worthwhile lying for a fortnight; a fortnight of life is not itself worth having, which is a proof that I write nothing here but pure truth.</p><p>(&ldquo;N.B.&mdash;Let me remember to consider; am I mad at this moment, or not? or rather at these moments? I have been told that consumptives sometimes do go out of their minds for a while in the last stages of the malady. I can prove this tomorrow when I read it out, by the impression it makes upon the audience. I must settle this question once and for all, otherwise I can&rsquo;t go on with anything.)</p></div> </div>
