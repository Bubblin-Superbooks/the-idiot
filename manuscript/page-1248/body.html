<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I believe I have just written dreadful nonsense; but there&rsquo;s no time for correcting, as I said before. Besides that, I have made myself a promise not to alter a single word of what I write in this paper, even though I find that I am contradicting myself every five lines. I wish to verify the working of the natural logic of my ideas tomorrow during the reading&mdash;whether I am capable of detecting logical errors, and whether all that I have meditated over during the last six months be true, or nothing but delirium.</p><p>&ldquo;If two months since I had been called upon to leave my room and the view of Meyer&rsquo;s wall opposite, I verily believe I should have been sorry. But now I have no such feeling, and yet I am leaving this room and Meyer&rsquo;s brick wall for ever.</p></div> </div>
