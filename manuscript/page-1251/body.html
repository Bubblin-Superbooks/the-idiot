<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Kislorodoff told me all this with a sort of exaggerated devil-may-care negligence, and as though he did me great honour by talking to me so, because it showed that he considered me the same sort of exalted Nihilistic being as himself, to whom death was a matter of no consequence whatever, either way.</p><p>&ldquo;At all events, the fact remained&mdash;a month of life and no more! That he is right in his estimation I am absolutely persuaded.</p><p>&ldquo;It puzzles me much to think how on earth the prince guessed yesterday that I have had bad dreams. He said to me, &lsquo;Your excitement and dreams will find relief at Pavlofsk.&rsquo; Why did he say &lsquo;dreams&rsquo;?

(But that he is an &lsquo;idiot,&rsquo; at bottom there can be no doubt whatever.)</p></div> </div>
