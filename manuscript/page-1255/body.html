Norma was a great Newfoundland, and died five years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;She sprang forward and stood still in front of the reptile as if she had been turned to stone. The beast stopped too, but its tail and claws still moved about. I believe animals are incapable of feeling supernatural fright&mdash;if I have been rightly informed,&mdash;but at this moment there appeared to me to be something more than ordinary about Norma&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
