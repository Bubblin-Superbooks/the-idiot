<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first time that I felt really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the prince&rsquo;s, at the very moment when I had taken it into my head to make a last trial of life. I wanted to see people and trees (I believe I said so myself), I got excited, I maintained Burdovsky&rsquo;s rights, &lsquo;my neighbour!&rsquo;&mdash;I dreamt that one and all would open their arms, and embrace me, that there would be an indescribable exchange of forgiveness between us all! In a word, I behaved like a fool, and then, at that very same instant, I felt my &lsquo;last conviction.&rsquo; I ask myself now how I could have waited six months for that conviction! I knew that I had a disease that spares no one, and I really had no illusions; but the more I realized my condition, the more I clung to life; I wanted to live at any price.</p></div> </div>
