<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Accursed wall! and yet it is dearer to me than all the Pavlofsk trees!&mdash;That is&mdash;it would be dearer if it were not all the same to me, now!</p><p>&ldquo;I remember now with what hungry interest I began to watch the lives of other people&mdash;interest that I had never felt before! I used to wait for Colia&rsquo;s arrival impatiently, for I was so ill myself, then, that I could not leave the house. I so threw myself into every little detail of news, and took so much interest in every report and rumour, that I believe I became a regular gossip! I could not understand, among other things, how all these people&mdash;with so much life in and before them&mdash;do not become rich&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t understand it now. I remember being told of a poor wretch I once knew, who had died of hunger.</p></div> </div>
