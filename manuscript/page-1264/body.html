<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Whose fault is it that they are all miserable, that they don&rsquo;t know how to live, though they have fifty or sixty years of life before them? Why did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived life before him?</p><p>&ldquo;And everyone of them shows his rags, his toil-worn hands, and yells in his wrath: &lsquo;Here are we, working like cattle all our lives, and always as hungry as dogs, and there are others who do not work, and are fat and rich!&rsquo; The eternal refrain! And side by side with them trots along some wretched fellow who has known better days, doing light porter&rsquo;s work from morn to night for a living, always blubbering and saying that &lsquo;his wife died because he had no money to buy medicine with,&rsquo; and his children dying of cold and hunger, and his eldest daughter gone to the bad, and so on.</p></div> </div>
