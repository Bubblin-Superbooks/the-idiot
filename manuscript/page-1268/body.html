<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What did the New World matter after all? Columbus had hardly seen it when he died, and in reality he was entirely ignorant of what he had discovered. The important thing is life&mdash;life and nothing else! What is any &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; whatever compared with the incessant, eternal discovery of life?</p><p>&ldquo;But what is the use of talking? I&rsquo;m afraid all this is so commonplace that my confession will be taken for a schoolboy exercise&mdash;the work of some ambitious lad writing in the hope of his work &lsquo;seeing the light&rsquo;; or perhaps my readers will say that &lsquo;I had perhaps something to say, but did not know how to express it.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
