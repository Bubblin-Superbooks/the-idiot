<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will not deceive you. &lsquo;Reality&rsquo; got me so entrapped in its meshes now and again during the past six months, that I forgot my &lsquo;sentence&rsquo; (or perhaps I did not wish to think of it), and actually busied myself with affairs.</p><p>&ldquo;A word as to my circumstances. When, eight months since, I became very ill, I threw up all my old connections and dropped all my old companions. As I was always a gloomy, morose sort of individual, my friends easily forgot me; of course, they would have forgotten me all the same, without that excuse. My position at home was solitary enough. Five months ago I separated myself entirely from the family, and no one dared enter my room except at stated times, to clean and tidy it, and so on, and to bring me my meals.</p></div> </div>
