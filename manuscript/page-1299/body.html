<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I, too, was burning to have my say!</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In Moscow,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there was an old state counsellor, a civil general, who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the prisons and speaking to criminals. Every party of convicts on its way to Siberia knew beforehand that on the Vorobeef Hills the &ldquo;old general&rdquo; would pay them a visit. He did all he undertook seriously and devotedly. He would walk down the rows of the unfortunate prisoners, stop before each individual and ask after his needs&mdash;he never sermonized them; he spoke kindly to them&mdash;he gave them money; he brought them all sorts of necessaries for the journey, and gave them devotional books, choosing those who could read, under the firm conviction that they would read to those who could not, as they went along.</p></div> </div>
