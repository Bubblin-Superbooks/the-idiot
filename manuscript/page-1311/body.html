<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;At moments I was in a state of dreadful weakness and misery, so that Colia was greatly disturbed when he left me.</p><p>&ldquo;When I arose to lock the door after him, I suddenly called to mind a picture I had noticed at Rogojin&rsquo;s in one of his gloomiest rooms, over the door. He had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it, and I believe I must have stood a good five minutes in front of it. There was nothing artistic about it, but the picture made me feel strangely uncomfortable. It represented Christ just taken down from the cross. It seems to me that painters as a rule represent the Saviour, both on the cross and taken down from it, with great beauty still upon His face. This marvellous beauty they strive to preserve even in His moments of deepest agony and passion. But there was no such beauty in Rogojin&rsquo;s picture.</p></div> </div>
