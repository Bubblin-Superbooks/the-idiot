<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is strange to look on this dreadful picture of the mangled corpse of the Saviour, and to put this question to oneself: &lsquo;Supposing that the disciples, the future apostles, the women who had followed Him and stood by the cross, all of whom believed in and worshipped Him&mdash;supposing that they saw this tortured body, this face so mangled and bleeding and bruised (and they must have so seen it)&mdash;how could they have gazed upon the dreadful sight and yet have believed that He would rise again?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The thought steps in, whether one likes it or no, that death is so terrible and so powerful, that even He who conquered it in His miracles during life was unable to triumph over it at the last. He who called to Lazarus, &lsquo;Lazarus, come forth!&rsquo; and the dead man lived&mdash;He was now Himself a prey to nature and death.</p></div> </div>
