Perhaps I am afraid&mdash;&rsquo; And no sooner did this last idea enter my head than an icy blast blew over me; I felt a chill down my backbone and my knees shook.</p><p>&ldquo;At this very moment, as though divining my thoughts, Rogojin raised his head from his arm and began to part his lips as though he were going to laugh&mdash;but he continued to stare at me as persistently as before.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt so furious with him at this moment that I longed to rush at him; but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie still&mdash;and the more willingly, as I was still by no means satisfied as to whether it really was Rogojin or not.</p></div> </div>
