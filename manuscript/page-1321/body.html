But at last Rogojin rose, staring at me as intently as ever, but not smiling any longer,&mdash;and walking very softly, almost on tip-toes, to the door, he opened it, went out, and shut it behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;I did not rise from my bed, and I don&rsquo;t know how long I lay with my eyes open, thinking. I don&rsquo;t know what I thought about, nor how I fell asleep or became insensible; but I awoke next morning after nine o&rsquo;clock when they knocked at my door. My general orders are that if I don&rsquo;t open the door and call, by nine o&rsquo;clock, Matreona is to come and bring my tea.</p></div> </div>
