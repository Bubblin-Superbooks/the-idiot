<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I had a small pocket pistol. I had procured it while still a boy, at that droll age when the stories of duels and highwaymen begin to delight one, and when one imagines oneself nobly standing fire at some future day, in a duel.</p><p>&ldquo;There were a couple of old bullets in the bag which contained the pistol, and powder enough in an old flask for two or three charges.</p><p>&ldquo;The pistol was a wretched thing, very crooked and wouldn&rsquo;t carry farther than fifteen paces at the most. However, it would send your skull flying well enough if you pressed the muzzle of it against your temple.</p></div> </div>
