<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I determined to die at Pavlofsk at sunrise, in the park&mdash;so as to make no commotion in the house.</p><p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;explanation&rsquo; will make the matter clear enough to the police. Students of psychology, and anyone else who likes, may make what they please of it. I should not like this paper, however, to be made public. I request the prince to keep a copy himself, and to give a copy to Aglaya Ivanovna Epanchin. This is my last will and testament. As for my skeleton, I bequeath it to the Medical Academy for the benefit of science.</p><p>&ldquo;I recognize no jurisdiction over myself, and I know that I am now beyond the power of laws and judges.</p></div> </div>
