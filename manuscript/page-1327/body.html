<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A little while ago a very amusing idea struck me. What if I were now to commit some terrible crime&mdash;murder ten fellow-creatures, for instance, or anything else that is thought most shocking and dreadful in this world&mdash;what a dilemma my judges would be in, with a criminal who only has a fortnight to live in any case, now that the rack and other forms of torture are abolished! Why, I should die comfortably in their own hospital&mdash;in a warm, clean room, with an attentive doctor&mdash;probably much more comfortably than I should at home.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why people in my position do not oftener indulge in such ideas&mdash;if only for a joke! Perhaps they do! Who knows! There are plenty of merry souls among us!</p></div> </div>
