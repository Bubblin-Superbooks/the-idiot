<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>why should anyone desire it? For the sake of morality? Well, I can understand that if I were to make an attempt upon my own life while in the enjoyment of full health and vigour&mdash;my life which might have been &lsquo;useful,&rsquo; etc., etc.&mdash;morality might reproach me, according to the old routine, for disposing of my life without permission&mdash;or whatever its tenet may be. But now, now, when my sentence is out and my days numbered! How can morality have need of my last breaths, and why should I die listening to the consolations offered by the prince, who, without doubt, would not omit to demonstrate that death is actually a benefactor to me? (Christians like him always end up with that&mdash;it is their pet theory.)</p></div> </div>
