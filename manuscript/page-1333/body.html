<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Religion!&mdash;I admit eternal life&mdash;and perhaps I always did admit it.</p><p>&ldquo;Admitted that consciousness is called into existence by the will of a Higher Power; admitted that this consciousness looks out upon the world and says &lsquo;I am;&rsquo; and admitted that the Higher Power wills that the consciousness so called into existence, be suddenly extinguished (for so&mdash;for some unexplained reason&mdash;it is and must be)&mdash;still there comes the eternal question&mdash;why must I be humble through all this? Is it not enough that I am devoured, without my being expected to bless the power that devours me? Surely&mdash;surely I need not suppose that Somebody&mdash;there&mdash;will be offended because I do not wish to live out the fortnight allowed me? I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p></div> </div>
