<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is much simpler, and far more likely, to believe that my death is needed&mdash;the death of an insignificant atom&mdash;in order to fulfil the general harmony of the universe&mdash;in order to make even some plus or minus in the sum of existence. Just as every day the death of numbers of beings is necessary because without their annihilation the rest cannot live on&mdash;(although we must admit that the idea is not a particularly grand one in itself!)</p><p>&ldquo;However&mdash;admit the fact! Admit that without such perpetual devouring of one another the world cannot continue to exist, or could never have been organized&mdash;I am ever ready to confess that I cannot understand why this is so&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do know, for certain.</p></div> </div>
