<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But it is so difficult, and even impossible to understand, that surely I am not to be blamed because I could not fathom the incomprehensible?</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I know they say that one must be obedient, and of course, too, the prince is one of those who say so: that one must be obedient without questions, out of pure goodness of heart, and that for my worthy conduct in this matter I shall meet with reward in another world. We degrade God when we attribute our own ideas to Him, out of annoyance that we cannot fathom His ways.</p><p>&ldquo;Again, I repeat, I cannot be blamed because I am unable to understand that which it is not given to mankind to fathom. Why am I to be judged because I could not comprehend the Will and Laws of Providence? No, we had better drop religion.</p></div> </div>
