Oh no, I should find strength enough, and if I wished it I could obtain consolation from the thought of the injury that is done me. But I am not a French poet, and I do not desire such consolation. And finally, nature has so limited my capacity for work or activity of any kind, in allotting me but three weeks of time, that suicide is about the only thing left that I can begin and end in the time of my own free will.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps then I am anxious to take advantage of my last chance of doing something for myself. A protest is sometimes no small thing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
