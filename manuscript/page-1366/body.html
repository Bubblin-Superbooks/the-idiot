Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree and away, and instantly he thought of the &ldquo;fly buzzing about in the sun&rsquo;s rays&rdquo; that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place and was a participator in the universal life, while he alone was an &ldquo;outcast.&rdquo; This picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated upon it now. An old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly burst into clearness and light. It was a recollection of Switzerland, during the first year of his cure, the very first months.
