<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every little fly that buzzed in the sun&rsquo;s rays was a singer in the universal chorus, &ldquo;knew its place, and was happy in it.&rdquo; Every blade of grass grew and was happy. Everything knew its path and loved it, went forth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing, understood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of nature&rsquo;s voices; he was a stranger and an outcast.</p><p>Oh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt! He had been tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have said these very words&mdash;even then&mdash;and that Hippolyte must have taken his picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time.</p></div> </div>
