<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At length a woman seemed to approach him. He knew her, oh! he knew her only too well. He could always name her and recognize her anywhere; but, strange, she seemed to have quite a different face from hers, as he had known it, and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she was not the same woman. In the face before him there was such dreadful remorse and horror that he thought she must be a criminal, that she must have just committed some awful crime.</p><p>Tears were trembling on her white cheek. She beckoned him, but placed her finger on her lip as though to warn him that he must follow her very quietly. His heart froze within him. He wouldn&rsquo;t, he couldn&rsquo;t confess her to be a criminal, and yet he felt that something dreadful would happen the next moment, something which would blast his whole life.</p></div> </div>
