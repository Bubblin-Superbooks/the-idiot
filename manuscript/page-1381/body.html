I shall see Hippolyte myself. Tell him so. As for you, I think you are behaving very badly, because it is not right to judge a man&rsquo;s soul as you are judging Hippolyte&rsquo;s. You have no gentleness, but only justice&mdash;so you are unjust.&rdquo;</p><p>The prince reflected.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you are unfair towards me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is nothing wrong in the thoughts I ascribe to Hippolyte; they are only natural.
