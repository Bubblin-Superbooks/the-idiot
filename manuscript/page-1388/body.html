<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I consider you the most honest and upright of men&mdash;more honest and upright than any other man; and if anybody says that your mind is&mdash;is sometimes affected, you know&mdash;it is unfair. I always say so and uphold it, because even if your surface mind be a little affected (of course you will not feel angry with me for talking so&mdash;I am speaking from a higher point of view) yet your real mind is far better than all theirs put together. Such a mind as they have never even dreamed of; because really, there are two minds&mdash;the kind that matters, and the kind that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May be! may be so!&rdquo; said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating painfully.</p></div> </div>
