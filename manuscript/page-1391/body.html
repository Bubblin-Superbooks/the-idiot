<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Run away from home?&rdquo; cried the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes! Run away from home!&rdquo; she repeated, in a transport of rage. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don&rsquo;t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, everything, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you. They began this before you arrived here, and so I didn&rsquo;t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody. I don&rsquo;t want to go to their balls and things&mdash;I want to do good.</p></div> </div>
