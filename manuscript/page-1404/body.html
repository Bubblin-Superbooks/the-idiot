Then you&mdash;like a wise man as you are&mdash;came back here after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to Petersburg. Yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just now you dreamed about her. You see, I know all. You did come back here for her, for her&mdash;now didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for her!&rdquo; said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his head down, quite unconscious of the fact that Aglaya was gazing at him with eyes which burned like live coals. &ldquo;I came to find out something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe in her future happiness as Rogojin&rsquo;s wife, although&mdash;in a word, I did not know how to help her or what to do for her&mdash;but I came, on the chance.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
