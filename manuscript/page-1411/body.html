She is mad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are the letters.&rdquo; (Aglaya took three letters out of her pocket and threw them down before the prince.) &ldquo;For a whole week she has been entreating and worrying and persuading me to marry you. She&mdash;well, she is clever, though she may be mad&mdash;much cleverer than I am, as you say. Well, she writes that she is in love with me herself, and tries to see me every day, if only from a distance. She writes that you love me, and that she has long known it and seen it, and that you and she talked about me&mdash;there. She wishes to see you happy, and she says that she is certain only I can ensure you the happiness you deserve. She writes such strange, wild letters&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t shown them to anyone. Now, do you know what all this means? Can you guess anything?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
