<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;God knows, Aglaya, that to restore her peace of mind and make her happy I would willingly give up my life. But I cannot love her, and she knows that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, make a sacrifice of yourself! That sort of thing becomes you well, you know. Why not do it? And don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;Aglaya&rsquo;; you have done it several times lately. You are bound, it is your duty to &lsquo;raise&rsquo; her; you must go off somewhere again to soothe and pacify her. Why, you love her, you know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot sacrifice myself so, though I admit I did wish to do so once. Who knows, perhaps I still wish to! But I know for certain, that if she married me it would be her ruin; I know this and therefore I leave her alone. I ought to go to see her today; now I shall probably not go.</p></div> </div>
