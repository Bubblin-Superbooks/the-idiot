Vera says you are going to let him stay on; I swear there&rsquo;s no danger, especially as we are always with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was by him at night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff. Keller stayed a little while, and then went over to Lebedeff&rsquo;s to sleep. Ferdishenko slept at Lebedeff&rsquo;s, too; but he went away at seven o&rsquo;clock. My father is always at Lebedeff&rsquo;s; but he has gone out just now. I dare say Lebedeff will be coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; I don&rsquo;t know what he wants. Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep? I&rsquo;m going to have a nap, too. By-the-by, such a curious thing happened. Burdovsky woke me at seven, and I met my father just outside the room, so drunk, he didn&rsquo;t even know me.</p></div> </div>
