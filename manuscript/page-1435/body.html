He came into the room on his way out; I was watching just then. He said he was going to spend &lsquo;the rest of the night&rsquo; at Wilkin&rsquo;s; there&rsquo;s a tipsy fellow, a friend of his, of that name. Well, I&rsquo;m off. Oh, here&rsquo;s Lebedeff himself! The prince wants to go to sleep, Lukian Timofeyovitch, so you may just go away again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One moment, my dear prince, just one. I must absolutely speak to you about something which is most grave,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, mysteriously and solemnly, entering the room with a bow and looking extremely important. He had but just returned, and carried his hat in his hand. He looked preoccupied and most unusually dignified.</p></div> </div>
