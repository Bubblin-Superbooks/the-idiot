<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s? No, no! prince, this is finesse, thieves&rsquo; finesse! This is as good as saying, &lsquo;There, how can I be a thief when I leave my address? I&rsquo;m not concealing my movements as a thief would.&rsquo; Do you understand, prince?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, but that is not enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Second proof. The scent turns out to be false, and the address given is a sham. An hour after&mdash;that is at about eight, I went to Wilkin&rsquo;s myself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko. The maid did tell me, certainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the door, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door because she didn&rsquo;t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy to get up herself. Such phenomena are met with occasionally!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
