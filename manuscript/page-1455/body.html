<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Where he goes, I go. He&rsquo;s quite given up visiting the captain&rsquo;s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly of her, especially in the morning, when he&rsquo;s putting on his boots. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s at that time. But he has no money, and it&rsquo;s no use his going to see her without. Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he has not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s ashamed to! He meant to ask you, I know, for he said so. I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you would probably refuse if he asked you again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
