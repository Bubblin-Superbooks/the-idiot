Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that&rsquo;s exaggeration; not life, we&rsquo;ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man fallen&mdash;money, indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, then you do give him money?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways. He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to Petersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I&rsquo;m certain he is there.</p></div> </div>
