But I am going to follow that naughty old general and catch him, I know where, at a certain widow&rsquo;s house; for I think it will be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Lebedeff, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t make any scandal about it!&rdquo; said the prince, much agitated, and speaking in a low voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for the world, not for the world! I merely wish to make him ashamed of himself. Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to myself, I cannot help thinking of his morals! I have a great favour to ask of you, esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of my visit.</p></div> </div>
