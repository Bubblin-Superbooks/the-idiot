You may be certain that I am most anxious to understand you, Lebedeff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you. We might manage it with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely watched in his own house. Unfortunately I am not on terms... otherwise... but Nicolai Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his youthful soul, might help, too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
