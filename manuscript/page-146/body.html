<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that time a great deal happened. Totski&rsquo;s position was very uncomfortable; having &ldquo;funked&rdquo; once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply afraid of Nastasia Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused.</p></div> </div>
