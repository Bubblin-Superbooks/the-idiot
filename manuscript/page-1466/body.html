Illustrious prince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest scoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or with a noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his choice! He&rsquo;ll answer that he prefers the noble-hearted man&mdash;and there you have the triumph of virtue! Au revoir, honoured prince! You and I together&mdash;softly! softly!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
