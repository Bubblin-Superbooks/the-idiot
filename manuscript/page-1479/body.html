This man also lived with his mother, and had a razor hidden away, tied round with white silk, and with this razor he intended to cut a throat.</p><p>&ldquo;All the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath the floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse, wrapped in oil-cloth, perhaps buried there by his father, who knows? Just as in the Moscow case. I could have shown you the very spot!</p><p>&ldquo;He is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he must hate me. My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have arranged with him. I have no secrets from him. I would kill him from very fright, but he will kill me first.</p></div> </div>
