<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nor does every husband feel bound to repeat at every step, &ldquo;Tu l&rsquo;as voulu, Georges Dandin!&rdquo; like another typical personage; and yet how many millions and billions of Georges Dandins there are in real life who feel inclined to utter this soul-drawn cry after their honeymoon, if not the day after the wedding! Therefore, without entering into any more serious examination of the question, I will content myself with remarking that in real life typical characters are &ldquo;watered down,&rdquo; so to speak; and all these Dandins and Podkoleosins actually exist among us every day, but in a diluted form. I will just add, however, that Georges Dandin might have existed exactly as Moli√®re presented him, and probably does exist now and then, though rarely; and so I will end this scientific examination, which is beginning to look like a newspaper criticism.</p></div> </div>
