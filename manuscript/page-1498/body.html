<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Many of our young women have thought fit to cut their hair short, put on blue spectacles, and call themselves Nihilists. By doing this they have been able to persuade themselves, without further trouble, that they have acquired new convictions of their own. Some men have but felt some little qualm of kindness towards their fellow-men, and the fact has been quite enough to persuade them that they stand alone in the van of enlightenment and that no one has such humanitarian feelings as they. Others have but to read an idea of somebody else&rsquo;s, and they can immediately assimilate it and believe that it was a child of their own brain. The &ldquo;impudence of ignorance,&rdquo; if I may use the expression, is developed to a wonderful extent in such cases;&mdash;unlikely as it appears, it is met with at every turn.</p></div> </div>
