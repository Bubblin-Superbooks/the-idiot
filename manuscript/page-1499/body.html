<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This confidence of a stupid man in his own talents has been wonderfully depicted by Gogol in the amazing character of Pirogoff. Pirogoff has not the slightest doubt of his own genius,&mdash;nay, of his superiority of genius,&mdash;so certain is he of it that he never questions it. How many Pirogoffs have there not been among our writers&mdash;scholars, propagandists? I say &ldquo;have been,&rdquo; but indeed there are plenty of them at this very day.</p><p>Our friend, Gania, belonged to the other class&mdash;to the &ldquo;much cleverer&rdquo; persons, though he was from head to foot permeated and saturated with the longing to be original. This class, as I have said above, is far less happy. For the &ldquo;clever commonplace&rdquo; person, though he may possibly imagine himself a man of genius and originality, none the less has within his heart the deathless worm of suspicion and doubt;</p></div> </div>
