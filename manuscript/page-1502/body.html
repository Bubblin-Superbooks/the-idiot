At the time of his &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; with Nastasia Philipovna he had come to the conclusion that money was his only hope&mdash;money should do all for him.</p><p>At the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia, he had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back to the prince. Of this returning of the money given to him by a madwoman who had received it from a madman, he had often repented since&mdash;though he never ceased to be proud of his action. During the short time that Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to come to hate him for his sympathy, though the prince told him that it was &ldquo;not everyone who would have acted so nobly&rdquo; as to return the money.</p></div> </div>
