Father has simply gone mad; mother&rsquo;s in floods of tears. Upon my word, Varia, I must kick him out of the house; or else go myself,&rdquo; he added, probably remembering that he could not well turn people out of a house which was not his own.</p><p>&ldquo;You must make allowances,&rdquo; murmured Varia.</p><p>&ldquo;Make allowances? For whom? Him&mdash;the old blackguard? No, no, Varia&mdash;that won&rsquo;t do! It won&rsquo;t do, I tell you! And look at the swagger of the man! He&rsquo;s all to blame himself, and yet he puts on so much &lsquo;side&rsquo; that you&rsquo;d think&mdash;my word!&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too much trouble to go through the gate, you must break the fence for me!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the sort of air he puts on; but what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Varia?
