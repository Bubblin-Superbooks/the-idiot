<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The prince is formally engaged to her&mdash;that&rsquo;s settled. The elder sisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They don&rsquo;t attempt to conceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to now. Adelaida&rsquo;s wedding is put off again, so that both can be married on one day. Isn&rsquo;t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought to write a poem on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up and down like that. This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she comes just in time&mdash;they have a party tonight. He is to be presented to old Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the engagement will be openly announced. They are only afraid that he may knock something down, or trip over something when he comes into the room. It would be just like him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
