<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How &lsquo;as he did yesterday&rsquo;? What do you mean? What did he do yesterday?&rdquo; asked Gania, in alarm.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, goodness me, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Varia stopped short.</p><p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean to say that he went there yesterday!&rdquo; cried Gania, flushing red with shame and anger. &ldquo;Good heavens, Varia! Speak! You have just been there. Was he there or not, quick?&rdquo; And Gania rushed for the door. Varia followed and caught him by both hands.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing? Where are you going to? You can&rsquo;t let him go now; if you do he&rsquo;ll go and do something worse.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
