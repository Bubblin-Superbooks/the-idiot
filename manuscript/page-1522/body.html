<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Father is a drunkard and a thief; I am a beggar, and the husband of my sister is a usurer,&rdquo; continued Gania, bitterly. &ldquo;There was a pretty list of advantages with which to enchant the heart of Aglaya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That same husband of your sister, the usurer&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feeds me? Go on. Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony, pray.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your temper. You are just like a schoolboy. You think that all this sort of thing would harm you in Aglaya&rsquo;s eyes, do you? You little know her character. She is capable of refusing the most brilliant party, and running away and starving in a garret with some wretched student; that&rsquo;s the sort of girl she is. You never could or did understand how interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you had come firmly and proudly through our misfortunes.</p></div> </div>
