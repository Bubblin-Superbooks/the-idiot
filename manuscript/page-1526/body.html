Lebedeff and the prince determined to tell no one&mdash;even Colia knows nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, Hippolyte? He found it out himself, of course. Why, you have no idea what a cunning little animal he is; dirty little gossip! He has the most extraordinary nose for smelling out other people&rsquo;s secrets, or anything approaching to scandal. Believe it or not, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he has got round Aglaya. If he hasn&rsquo;t, he soon will. Rogojin is intimate with him, too. How the prince doesn&rsquo;t notice it, I can&rsquo;t understand. The little wretch considers me his enemy now and does his best to catch me tripping. What on earth does it matter to him, when he&rsquo;s dying? However, you&rsquo;ll see; I shall catch him tripping yet, and not he me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
