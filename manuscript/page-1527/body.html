And is it really worth your while to try to score off him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, it was yourself who advised me to bring him over!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought he might be useful. You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s not dangerous there!&rdquo; cried Gania, laughing angrily. &ldquo;However, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won&rsquo;t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first.</p></div> </div>
