<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hippolyte had now been five days at the Ptitsins&rsquo;. His flitting from the prince&rsquo;s to these new quarters had been brought about quite naturally and without many words. He did not quarrel with the prince&mdash;in fact, they seemed to part as friends. Gania, who had been hostile enough on that eventful evening, had himself come to see him a couple of days later, probably in obedience to some sudden impulse. For some reason or other, Rogojin too had begun to visit the sick boy. The prince thought it might be better for him to move away from his (the prince&rsquo;s) house. Hippolyte informed him, as he took his leave, that Ptitsin &ldquo;had been kind enough to offer him a corner,&rdquo; and did not say a word about Gania, though Gania had procured his invitation, and himself came to fetch him away. Gania noticed this at the time, and put it to Hippolyte&rsquo;s debit on account.</p></div> </div>
