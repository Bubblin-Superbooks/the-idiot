I mean, Kapiton Alexeyevitch&mdash;retired major&mdash;married Maria Petrovna Lu&mdash;Lu&mdash;he was my friend and companion&mdash;Lutugoff&mdash;from our earliest beginnings. I closed his eyes for him&mdash;he was killed. Kapiton Eropegoff never existed! tfu!&rdquo;</p><p>The general shouted in his fury; but it was to be concluded that his wrath was not kindled by the expressed doubt as to Kapiton&rsquo;s existence. This was his scapegoat; but his excitement was caused by something quite different. As a rule he would have merely shouted down the doubt as to Kapiton, told a long yarn about his friend, and eventually retired upstairs to his room. But today, in the strange uncertainty of human nature, it seemed to require but so small an offence as this to make his cup to overflow. The old man grew purple in the face, he raised his hands. &ldquo;Enough of this!&rdquo; he yelled.</p></div> </div>
