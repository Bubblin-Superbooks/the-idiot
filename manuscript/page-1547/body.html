<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;two words! I am Varvara Ardalionovna&rsquo;s guest, not yours; you have extended no hospitality to me. On the contrary, if I am not mistaken, I believe you are yourself indebted to Mr. Ptitsin&rsquo;s hospitality. Four days ago I begged my mother to come down here and find lodgings, because I certainly do feel better here, though I am not fat, nor have I ceased to cough. I am today informed that my room is ready for me; therefore, having thanked your sister and mother for their kindness to me, I intend to leave the house this evening. I beg your pardon&mdash;I interrupted you&mdash;I think you were about to add something?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
