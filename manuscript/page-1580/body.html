It is too much neglected. As for me, much esteemed prince, I am sensible of having experienced the honour of your confidence in a certain matter up to a certain point, but never beyond that point. I do not for a moment complain&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lebedeff, you seem to be angry for some reason!&rdquo; said the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;Not the least bit in the world, esteemed and revered prince! Not the least bit in the world!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, solemnly, with his hand upon his heart. &ldquo;On the contrary, I am too painfully aware that neither by my position in the world, nor by my gifts of intellect and heart, nor by my riches, nor by any former conduct of mine, have I in any way deserved your confidence, which is far above my highest aspirations and hopes.</p></div> </div>
