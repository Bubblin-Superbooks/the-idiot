You mean the four hundred roubles!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, dragging the words out, just as though it had only just dawned upon him what the prince was talking about. &ldquo;Thanks very much, prince, for your kind interest&mdash;you do me too much honour. I found the money, long ago!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You found it? Thank God for that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your exclamation proves the generous sympathy of your nature, prince; for four hundred roubles&mdash;to a struggling family man like myself&mdash;is no small matter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that; at least, of course, I&rsquo;m glad for your sake, too,&rdquo; added the prince, correcting himself, &ldquo;but&mdash;how did you find it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
