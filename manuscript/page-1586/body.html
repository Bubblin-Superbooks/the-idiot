<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very simply indeed! I found it under the chair upon which my coat had hung; so that it is clear the purse simply fell out of the pocket and on to the floor!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under the chair? Impossible! Why, you told me yourself that you had searched every corner of the room? How could you not have looked in the most likely place of all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I looked there,&mdash;of course I did! Very much so! I looked and scrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldn&rsquo;t believe it was not there, and looked again and again. It is always so in such cases. One longs and expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and the place is as bare as one&rsquo;s palm; and yet one returns and looks again and again, fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
