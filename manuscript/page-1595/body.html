<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and pretend I never guessed where it was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said the prince, thoughtfully; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late for that&mdash;that would be dangerous now. No, no! Better say nothing about it. Be nice with him, you know, but don&rsquo;t show him&mdash;oh, you know well enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, prince, of course I know, but I&rsquo;m afraid I shall not carry it out; for to do so one needs a heart like your own. He is so very irritable just now, and so proud. At one moment he will embrace me, and the next he flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the lining forward on purpose. Well, au revoir, prince, I see I am keeping you, and boring you, too, interfering with your most interesting private reflections.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
