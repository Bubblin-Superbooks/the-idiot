I broke with him last night, and am very sorry that I did not do so before. I expect respect, prince, even from those to whom I give my heart, so to speak. Prince, I have often given away my heart, and am nearly always deceived. This person was quite unworthy of the gift.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is much that might be improved in him,&rdquo; said the prince, moderately, &ldquo;but he has some qualities which&mdash;though amid them one cannot but discern a cunning nature&mdash;reveal what is often a diverting intellect.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
