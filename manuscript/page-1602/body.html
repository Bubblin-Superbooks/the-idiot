<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The prince&rsquo;s tone was so natural and respectful that the general could not possibly suspect him of any insincerity.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that he possesses good traits, I was the first to show, when I very nearly made him a present of my friendship. I am not dependent upon his hospitality, and upon his house; I have my own family. I do not attempt to justify my own weakness. I have drunk with this man, and perhaps I deplore the fact now, but I did not take him up for the sake of drink alone (excuse the crudeness of the expression, prince); I did not make friends with him for that alone. I was attracted by his good qualities; but when the fellow declares that he was a child in 1812, and had his left leg cut off, and buried in the Vagarkoff cemetery, in Moscow, such a cock-and-bull story amounts to disrespect, my dear sir, to&mdash;to impudent exaggeration.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
