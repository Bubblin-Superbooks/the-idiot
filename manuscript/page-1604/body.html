<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, but Lebedeff cannot have been in Moscow in 1812. He is much too young; it is all nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well, but even if we admit that he was alive in 1812, can one believe that a French chasseur pointed a cannon at him for a lark, and shot his left leg off? He says he picked his own leg up and took it away and buried it in the cemetery. He swore he had a stone put up over it with the inscription: &lsquo;Here lies the leg of Collegiate Secretary Lebedeff,&rsquo; and on the other side, &lsquo;Rest, beloved ashes, till the morn of joy,&rsquo; and that he has a service read over it every year (which is simply sacrilege), and goes to Moscow once a year on purpose.</p></div> </div>
