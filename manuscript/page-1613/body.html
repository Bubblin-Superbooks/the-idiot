<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, in a couple of days I was known all over the palace and the Kremlin as &lsquo;le petit boyard.&rsquo; I only went home to sleep. They were nearly out of their minds about me at home. A couple of days after this, Napoleon&rsquo;s page, De Bazancour, died; he had not been able to stand the trials of the campaign. Napoleon remembered me; I was taken away without explanation; the dead page&rsquo;s uniform was tried on me, and when I was taken before the emperor, dressed in it, he nodded his head to me, and I was told that I was appointed to the vacant post of page.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was glad enough, for I had long felt the greatest sympathy for this man; and then the pretty uniform and all that&mdash;only a child, you know&mdash;and so on.</p></div> </div>
