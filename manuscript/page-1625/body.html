He looked at me kindly. &lsquo;You are sorry for me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you, my child, and perhaps one other child&mdash;my son, the King of Rome&mdash;may grieve for me. All the rest hate me; and my brothers are the first to betray me in misfortune.&rsquo; I sobbed and threw myself into his arms. He could not resist me&mdash;he burst into tears, and our tears mingled as we folded each other in a close embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Write, oh, write a letter to the Empress Josephine!&rsquo; I cried, sobbing. Napoleon started, reflected, and said, &lsquo;You remind me of a third heart which loves me. Thank you, my friend;&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
