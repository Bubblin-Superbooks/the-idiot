When I die, Colia, you must engrave on my tomb:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here lies a Dead Soul, Shame pursues me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said that, Colia?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was no Eropegoff? Eroshka Eropegoff?&rdquo; he cried, suddenly, stopping in the road in a frenzy. &ldquo;No Eropegoff! And my own son to say it! Eropegoff was in the place of a brother to me for eleven months. I fought a duel for him. He was married afterwards, and then killed on the field of battle. The bullet struck the cross on my breast and glanced off straight into his temple. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget you,&rsquo; he cried, and expired.</p></div> </div>
