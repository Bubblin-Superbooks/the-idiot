Why don&rsquo;t you wish to come back home? Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it, I&rsquo;ll explain all to you. Don&rsquo;t shout! You shall hear. Le roi de Rome. Oh, I am sad, I am melancholy!</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nurse, where is your tomb?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said that, Colia?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know who said it. Come home at once; come on! I&rsquo;ll punch Gania&rsquo;s head myself, if you like&mdash;only come. Oh, where are you off to again?&rdquo; The general was dragging him away towards the door of a house nearby. He sat down on the step, still holding Colia by the hand.</p></div> </div>
