Very likely, with the perspicacity of her sex, she gave out as an accomplished fact what she felt was pretty sure to become a fact in a few days. Perhaps she could not resist the satisfaction of pouring one last drop of bitterness into her brother Gania&rsquo;s cup, in spite of her love for him. At all events, she had been unable to obtain any definite news from the Epanchin girls&mdash;the most she could get out of them being hints and surmises, and so on. Perhaps Aglaya&rsquo;s sisters had merely been pumping Varia for news while pretending to impart information; or perhaps, again, they had been unable to resist the feminine gratification of teasing a friend&mdash;for, after all this time, they could scarcely have helped divining the aim of her frequent visits.</p></div> </div>
