Whom can he be shown to? Where can you take him to? What will old Bielokonski say? We never thought of such a husband as that for our Aglaya!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, the last argument was the chief one. The maternal heart trembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in that heart there rose another voice, which said: &ldquo;And why is not the prince such a husband as you would have desired for Aglaya?&rdquo; It was this voice which annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else.</p></div> </div>
