Now, at once?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him,&rdquo; the general explained hastily. &ldquo;He is quite a child, not to say a pathetic-looking creature. He has fits of some sort, and has just arrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a German and without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five roubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices. I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
