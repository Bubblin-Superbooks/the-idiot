This is our real Aglaya at last!&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p><p>Aglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her mother&rsquo;s breast, glanced at her father, and burst out laughing. She sprang at him and hugged him too, and kissed him over and over again. She then rushed back to her mother and hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in more tears. Her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you cruel little girl! How will you treat us all next, I wonder?&rdquo; she said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though she breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long.</p></div> </div>
