You never know anything thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyone&rsquo;s name, nor dates, nor about treaties and so on. It&rsquo;s a great pity, you know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you I had not had much of an education,&rdquo; replied the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;How am I to respect you, if that&rsquo;s the case? Read on now. No&mdash;don&rsquo;t! Stop reading!&rdquo;</p><p>And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all. Prince S. had returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a great deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch. (Muishkin had not come in as yet.)</p></div> </div>
