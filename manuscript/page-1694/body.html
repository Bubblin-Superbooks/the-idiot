Stupid bosh it was&mdash;written in delirium. And I can&rsquo;t understand how anyone can be so&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say cruel, because the word would be humiliating to myself, but we&rsquo;ll say childishly vain and revengeful, as to reproach me with this confession, and use it as a weapon against me. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, I&rsquo;m not referring to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m sorry you repudiate the confession, Hippolyte&mdash;it is sincere; and, do you know, even the absurd parts of it&mdash;and these are many&rdquo; (here Hippolyte frowned savagely) &ldquo;are, as it were, redeemed by suffering&mdash;</p></div> </div>
