He has developed the idea&mdash;or pretends to believe&mdash;that in all probability three or four others who heard my confession will die before I do. There&rsquo;s an idea for you&mdash;and all this by way of consoling me! Ha! ha! ha! In the first place they haven&rsquo;t died yet; and in the second, if they did die&mdash;all of them&mdash;what would be the satisfaction to me in that? He judges me by himself. But he goes further, he actually pitches into me because, as he declares, &lsquo;any decent fellow&rsquo; would die quietly, and that &lsquo;all this&rsquo; is mere egotism on my part.</p></div> </div>
