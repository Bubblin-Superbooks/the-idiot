<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He doesn&rsquo;t see what refinement of egotism it is on his own part&mdash;and at the same time, what ox-like coarseness! Have you ever read of the death of one Stepan Gleboff, in the eighteenth century? I read of it yesterday by chance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was impaled on a stake in the time of Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know! He lay there fifteen hours in the hard frost, and died with the most extraordinary fortitude&mdash;I know&mdash;what of him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only that God gives that sort of dying to some, and not to others. Perhaps you think, though, that I could not die like Gleboff?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
