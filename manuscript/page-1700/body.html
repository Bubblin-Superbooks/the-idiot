<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with which you disagreed with me&mdash;eh? Ha! ha! ha! You are a regular child, prince! However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me like&mdash;like a fragile china cup. Never mind, never mind, I&rsquo;m not a bit angry! At all events we have had a very funny talk. Do you know, all things considered, I should like to be something better than Osterman! I wouldn&rsquo;t take the trouble to rise from the dead to be an Osterman. However, I see I must make arrangements to die soon, or I myself&mdash;. Well&mdash;leave me now! Au revoir. Look here&mdash;before you go, just give me your opinion: how do you think I ought to die, now? I mean&mdash;the best, the most virtuous way? Tell me!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
