I always did feel a loathing for the laws which seem to guide mamma&rsquo;s conduct at times. I don&rsquo;t speak of father, for he cannot be expected to be anything but what he is. Mother is a noble-minded woman, I know; you try to suggest anything mean to her, and you&rsquo;ll see! But she is such a slave to these miserable creatures! I don&rsquo;t mean old Bielokonski alone. She is a contemptible old thing, but she is able to twist people round her little finger, and I admire that in her, at all events! How mean it all is, and how foolish! We were always middle-class, thoroughly middle-class, people. Why should we attempt to climb into the giddy heights of the fashionable world? My sisters are all for it. It&rsquo;s Prince S. they have to thank for poisoning their minds. Why are you so glad that Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
