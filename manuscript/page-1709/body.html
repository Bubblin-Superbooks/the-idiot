<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Aglaya,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I do believe you are nervous lest I shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nervous about you?&rdquo; Aglaya blushed. &ldquo;Why should I be nervous about you? What would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of yourself? How can you say such a thing? What do you mean by &lsquo;making a fool of yourself&rsquo;? What a vulgar expression! I suppose you intend to talk in that sort of way tomorrow evening? Look up a few more such expressions in your dictionary; do, you&rsquo;ll make a grand effect! I&rsquo;m sorry that you seem to be able to come into a room as gracefully as you do; where did you learn the art? Do you think you can drink a cup of tea decently, when you know everybody is looking at you, on purpose to see how you do it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
