And who was he?&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.</p><p>&ldquo;The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,&rdquo; began the prince; &ldquo;he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where our present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I copied it. When the general asked me, in his study, to write something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote &lsquo;The Abbot Pafnute signed this,&rsquo; in the exact handwriting of the abbot. The general liked it very much, and that&rsquo;s why he recalled it just now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
