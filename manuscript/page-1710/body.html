<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you? I&rsquo;m sorry for it then, for I should have had a good laugh at you otherwise. Do break something at least, in the drawing-room! Upset the Chinese vase, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s a valuable one; do break it. Mamma values it, and she&rsquo;ll go out of her mind&mdash;it was a present. She&rsquo;ll cry before everyone, you&rsquo;ll see! Wave your hand about, you know, as you always do, and just smash it. Sit down near it on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I shall sit as far from it as I can. Thanks for the hint.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
