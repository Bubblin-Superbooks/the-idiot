<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do. You said you&rsquo;d &lsquo;plead sick-list&rsquo; just now; where in the world do you get hold of such expressions? Why do you talk to me like this? Are you trying to irritate me, or what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, it&rsquo;s a schoolboy expression. I won&rsquo;t do it again. I know quite well, I see it, that you are anxious on my account (now, don&rsquo;t be angry), and it makes me very happy to see it. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how frightened I am of misbehaving somehow, and how glad I am of your instructions. But all this panic is simply nonsense, you know, Aglaya! I give you my word it is; I am so pleased that you are such a child, such a dear good child. How charming you can be if you like, Aglaya.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
