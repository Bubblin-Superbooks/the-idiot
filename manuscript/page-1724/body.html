<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> so when I sent her up a note from myself, with the letter, you know, in order to fix a meeting for eight o&rsquo;clock this morning, I signed it &lsquo;your secret correspondent.&rsquo; They let me in at once&mdash;very quickly&mdash;by the back door, and the noble lady received me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well? Go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact so nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head. She threw the letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would have liked to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face instead. &lsquo;If anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like you to deliver the letter,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;take it and deliver it!&rsquo; Hey! she was grandly indignant. A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
