<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. Come along; you sit here, opposite to me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I wish to be able to see your face. Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn&rsquo;t seem so very ill, does he? I don&rsquo;t think he requires a napkin under his chin, after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Formerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one; but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
