And about your fits?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fits?&rdquo; asked the prince, slightly surprised. &ldquo;I very seldom have fits nowadays. I don&rsquo;t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate may be bad for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He talks very well, you know!&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. &ldquo;I really did not expect it at all; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general&rsquo;s part, as usual. Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
