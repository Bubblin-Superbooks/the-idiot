He knew very well that he must tell some story this evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with the inspiration of anticipatory triumph.</p><p>The prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never yet come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy as was shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story was the oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room in town was sick to death of it.</p></div> </div>
