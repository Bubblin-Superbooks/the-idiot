<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Aglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him with an unusual display of friendliness. Evgenie himself behaved rather more sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary. Evgenie had been known in society for a long while. He had appeared at the Epanchins&rsquo; today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski had commended this action on his part. Not every society man would have worn crape for &ldquo;such an uncle.&rdquo; Lizabetha Prokofievna had liked it also, but was too preoccupied to take much notice. The prince remarked that Aglaya looked attentively at him two or three times, and seemed to be satisfied with his behaviour.</p><p>Little by little he became very happy indeed. All his late anxieties and apprehensions (after his conversation with Lebedeff) now appeared like so many bad dreams&mdash;impossible, and even laughable.</p></div> </div>
