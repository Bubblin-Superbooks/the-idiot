I don&rsquo;t remember who the abbot was, but I remember at one time everybody was talking about it,&rdquo; remarked the old dignitary.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Abbot Gurot, a Jesuit,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the sort of thing our best men are apt to do. A man of rank, too, and rich&mdash;a man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything; and then to throw up the service and everything else in order to go over to Roman Catholicism and turn Jesuit&mdash;openly, too&mdash;almost triumphantly. By Jove! it was positively a mercy that he died when he did&mdash;it was indeed&mdash;everyone said so at the time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
