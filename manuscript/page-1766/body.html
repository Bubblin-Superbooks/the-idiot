What is it, then?&rdquo; asked Ivan Petrovitch, turning to the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not a Christian religion, in the first place,&rdquo; said the latter, in extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the moment. &ldquo;And in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion, worse than Atheism itself. Yes&mdash;that is my opinion. Atheism only preaches a negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a disfigured, distorted Christ&mdash;it preaches Anti-Christ&mdash;I assure you, I swear it! This is my own personal conviction, and it has long distressed me. The Roman Catholic believes that the Church on earth cannot stand without universal temporal Power.</p></div> </div>
