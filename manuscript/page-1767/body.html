<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He cries &lsquo;non possumus!&rsquo; In my opinion the Roman Catholic religion is not a faith at all, but simply a continuation of the Roman Empire, and everything is subordinated to this idea&mdash;beginning with faith. The Pope has seized territories and an earthly throne, and has held them with the sword. And so the thing has gone on, only that to the sword they have added lying, intrigue, deceit, fanaticism, superstition, swindling;&mdash;they have played fast and loose with the most sacred and sincere feelings of men;&mdash;they have exchanged everything&mdash;everything for money, for base earthly power! And is this not the teaching of Anti-Christ? How could the upshot of all this be other than Atheism? Atheism is the child of Roman Catholicism&mdash;it proceeded from these Romans themselves, though perhaps they would not believe it.</p></div> </div>
