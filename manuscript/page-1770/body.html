<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> not by Christ, but by force. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to believe in God, don&rsquo;t dare to possess any individuality, any property! Fraternit√© ou la Mort; two million heads. &lsquo;By their works ye shall know them&rsquo;&mdash;we are told. And we must not suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to ourselves. Oh, no; we must resist, and quickly, quickly! We must let our Christ shine forth upon the Western nations, our Christ whom we have preserved intact, and whom they have never known. Not as slaves, allowing ourselves to be caught by the hooks of the Jesuits, but carrying our Russian civilization to them, we must stand before them, not letting it be said among us that their preaching is &lsquo;skilful,&rsquo; as someone expressed it just now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
