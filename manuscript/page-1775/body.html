<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; That is not my own expression; it is the expression of a merchant, one of the Old Believers, whom I once met while travelling. He did not say exactly these words. I think his expression was:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whoso forsakes his country forsakes his God.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But let these thirsty Russian souls find, like Columbus&rsquo; discoverers, a new world; let them find the Russian world, let them search and discover all the gold and treasure that lies hid in the bosom of their own land! Show them the restitution of lost humanity, in the future, by Russian thought alone, and by means of the God and of the Christ of our Russian faith, and you will see how mighty and just and wise and good a giant will rise up before the eyes of the astonished and frightened world; astonished because they expect nothing but the sword from us, because they think they will get nothing out of us but barbarism.</p></div> </div>
