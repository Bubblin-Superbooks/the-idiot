<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you forgive me all&mdash;all, besides the vase, I mean?&rdquo; said the prince, rising from his seat once more, but the old gentleman caught his hand and drew him down again&mdash;he seemed unwilling to let him go.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est très-curieux et c&rsquo;est très-sérieux,&rdquo; he whispered across the table to Ivan Petrovitch, rather loudly. Probably the prince heard him.</p><p>&ldquo;So that I have not offended any of you? You will not believe how happy I am to be able to think so. It is as it should be. As if I could offend anyone here! I should offend you again by even suggesting such a thing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
