<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had always heard so much that was evil said of you all&mdash;more evil than good; as to how small and petty were your interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your education, and so on. There is so much written and said about you! I came here today with anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and form my own convictions as to whether it were true that the whole of this upper stratum of Russian society is worthless, has outlived its time, has existed too long, and is only fit to die&mdash;and yet is dying with petty, spiteful warring against that which is destined to supersede it and take its place&mdash;hindering the Coming Men, and knowing not that itself is in a dying condition. I did not fully believe in this view even before, for there never was such a class among us&mdash;excepting perhaps at court, by accident&mdash;or by uniform; but now there is not even that, is there? It has vanished, has it not?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
