<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>was it not shameful of me? Was I afraid of finding a bottomless abyss of empty selfishness? Ah! that&rsquo;s why I am so happy at this moment, because I find there is no bottomless abyss at all&mdash;but good, healthy material, full of life.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it? For we really are odd, you know&mdash;careless, reckless, easily wearied of anything. We don&rsquo;t look thoroughly into matters&mdash;don&rsquo;t care to understand things. We are all like this&mdash;you and I, and all of them! Why, here are you, now&mdash;you are not a bit angry with me for calling you &lsquo;odd,&rsquo; are you? And, if so, surely there is good material in you? Do you know, I sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd. We can forgive one another more easily, and be more humble.</p></div> </div>
