<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Listen&mdash;I know it is best not to speak! It is best simply to give a good example&mdash;simply to begin the work. I have done this&mdash;I have begun, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh! can anyone be unhappy, really? Oh! what does grief matter&mdash;what does misfortune matter, if one knows how to be happy? Do you know, I cannot understand how anyone can pass by a green tree, and not feel happy only to look at it! How anyone can talk to a man and not feel happy in loving him! Oh, it is my own fault that I cannot express myself well enough! But there are lovely things at every step I take&mdash;things which even the most miserable man must recognize as beautiful. Look at a little child&mdash;look at God&rsquo;s day dawn&mdash;look at the grass growing&mdash;look at the eyes that love you, as they gaze back into your eyes!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
