I began to ask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals&mdash;strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All this is very strange and interesting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. What are you laughing at, Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen? You have never been abroad.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
