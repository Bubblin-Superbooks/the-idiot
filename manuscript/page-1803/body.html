<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In reply to a very guarded question of her sisters&rsquo;, Aglaya had answered coldly, but exceedingly haughtily:</p><p>&ldquo;I have never given him my word at all, nor have I ever counted him as my future husband&mdash;never in my life. He is just as little to me as all the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly flared up.</p><p>&ldquo;I did not expect that of you, Aglaya,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is an impossible husband for you,&mdash;I know it; and thank God that we agree upon that point; but I did not expect to hear such words from you. I thought I should hear a very different tone from you. I would have turned out everyone who was in the room last night and kept him,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the sort of man he is, in my opinion!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
