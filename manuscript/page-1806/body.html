<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This same morning dawned for the prince pregnant with no less painful presentiments,&mdash;which fact his physical state was, of course, quite enough to account for; but he was so indefinably melancholy,&mdash;his sadness could not attach itself to anything in particular, and this tormented him more than anything else. Of course certain facts stood before him, clear and painful, but his sadness went beyond all that he could remember or imagine; he realized that he was powerless to console himself unaided. Little by little he began to develop the expectation that this day something important, something decisive, was to happen to him.</p><p>His attack of yesterday had been a slight one. Excepting some little heaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any particular effects. His brain worked all right, though his soul was heavy within him.</p></div> </div>
