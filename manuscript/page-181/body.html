All three of the girls laughed out loud, and the prince laughed with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad of you,&rdquo; said mamma. &ldquo;You must forgive them, prince; they are good girls. I am very fond of them, though I often have to be scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, why shouldn&rsquo;t they laugh?&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let the chance go by in their place, I know. But I stick up for the donkey, all the same; he&rsquo;s a patient, good-natured fellow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
