H&rsquo;m! so you can see that there was a &lsquo;scene,&rsquo; can you? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much, for everyone must realize now that it is impossible to be hard on you. Well, au revoir. I advise you to have a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual, if you feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens, and whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of the family&mdash;mine, at all events. I can answer for myself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
