Hippolyte laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that I am going to leave your house,&rdquo; he continued, still gasping and coughing. &ldquo;On the contrary, I thought it absolutely necessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled you. I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that I am off! It&rsquo;s all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me. I lay down this morning at ten o&rsquo;clock with the intention of not rising again before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more in order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason for wishing to come.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
