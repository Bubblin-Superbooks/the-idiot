<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know nothing! You say &lsquo;very well; let&rsquo;s leave it so.&rsquo; But I say, don&rsquo;t be so confiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply because you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have in their minds&rsquo; eye&mdash;Gania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious? Well, well, I&rsquo;ll drop the subject!&rdquo; he added, hastily, observing the prince&rsquo;s impatient gesture. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come to you on my own business; I wish to make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one cannot die without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them already. Do you wish to hear what I have to say?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
