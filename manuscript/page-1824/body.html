She jumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and suddenly observed: &lsquo;I only came here to express my gratitude for all your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your services, believe me&mdash;&rsquo; Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they both marched off again, looking very foolish. Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
