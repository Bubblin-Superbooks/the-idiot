I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings, for once. I&rsquo;ll console you a little now, after your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a moral one?&rdquo; asked the prince, involuntarily.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;not a physical one! I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone&mdash;even a woman&mdash;would raise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate! I did think at one time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though.</p></div> </div>
