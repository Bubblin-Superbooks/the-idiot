<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave that question just now. Why am I a scandal-monger? Why did she call me a scandal-monger? And mind, after she had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of questions besides&mdash;but such is the way of women. For her sake I entered into relations with Rogojin&mdash;an interesting man! At her request I arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia Philipovna. Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was enjoying Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s &lsquo;leavings&rsquo;? Why, I have been impressing it upon her all this while for her own good. Two letters have I written her in that strain, and I began straight off today about its being humiliating for her. Besides, the word &lsquo;leavings&rsquo; is not my invention.</p></div> </div>
