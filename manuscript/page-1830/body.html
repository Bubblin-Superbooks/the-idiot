And yet&mdash;where should you have heard it? Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room it&rsquo;s known all over the place here. However, I&rsquo;ve warned you, and you may be grateful to me. Well&mdash;au revoir&mdash;probably in the next world! One more thing&mdash;don&rsquo;t think that I am telling you all this for your sake. Oh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya Ivanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am not acting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved like a cad to you, I have not done her any harm. I don&rsquo;t apologize for my words about &lsquo;leavings&rsquo; and all that. I am atoning for that, you see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting.</p></div> </div>
