<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I began to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very day I made his acquaintance, and when I heard&mdash;afterwards&mdash;of all that took place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he was such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his soul, believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character. What I feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured him, and threw him over. You could not love him because you are too proud&mdash;no, not proud, that is an error; because you are too vain&mdash;no, not quite that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness. Your letters to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a soul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at him. All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that you were disgraced and insulted.</p></div> </div>
