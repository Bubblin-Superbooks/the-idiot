Did you come to me without your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna? Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today? Shall I tell you without any embellishments? You came because you were afraid of me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Afraid of you?&rdquo; asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement that the other should dare talk to her like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, me, of course! Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not have decided to come. You cannot despise one you fear. And to think that I have actually esteemed you up to this very moment! Do you know why you are afraid of me, and what is your object now? You wished to satisfy yourself with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself or you, because you are fearfully jealous.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
