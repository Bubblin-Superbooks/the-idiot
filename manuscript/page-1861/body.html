<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Heavens! what a fool I have been to humiliate myself before them! Why, prince, you yourself gave me your word that you would marry me whatever happened, and would never abandon me. You said you loved me and would forgive me all, and&mdash;and resp&mdash;yes, you even said that! I only ran away from you in order to set you free, and now I don&rsquo;t care to let you go again. Why does she treat me so&mdash;so shamefully? I am not a loose woman&mdash;ask Rogojin there! He&rsquo;ll tell you. Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before your eyes, too; turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm? May you be accursed too, for you were the only one I trusted among them all! Go away, Rogojin, I don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
