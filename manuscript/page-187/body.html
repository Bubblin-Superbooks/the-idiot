I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the prince, laughing too. &ldquo;I lived almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve&mdash;then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
