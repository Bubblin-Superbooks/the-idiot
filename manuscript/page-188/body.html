<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;So that you didn&rsquo;t care to go away anywhere else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn&rsquo;t know however I should manage to support life&mdash;you know there are such moments, especially in solitude. There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of water, like a thread but white and moving. It fell from a great height, but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not seem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then that I became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away.</p></div> </div>
