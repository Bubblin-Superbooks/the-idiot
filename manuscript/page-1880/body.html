She asked him whether he would consent to hold his finger to a lighted candle in proof of his devotion! Gania&mdash;it was said&mdash;looked so comically bewildered that Aglaya had almost laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed out of the room and upstairs,&mdash;where her parents had found her.</p></div> </div>
