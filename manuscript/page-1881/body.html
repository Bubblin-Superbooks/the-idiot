<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose. When Muishkin heard about the candle and Gania&rsquo;s finger he had laughed so that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,&mdash;and then shuddered and burst into tears. The prince&rsquo;s condition during those days was strange and perturbed. Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his mind;&mdash;this, however, was hardly to be relied upon.</p><p>Offering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them, we do not for a moment desire to justify our hero&rsquo;s conduct. On the contrary, we are quite prepared to feel our share of the indignation which his behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends. Even Vera Lebedeff was angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller, until he was selected for best man; so was Lebedeff himself,&mdash;who began to intrigue against him out of pure irritation;</p></div> </div>
