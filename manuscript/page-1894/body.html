<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite right,&rdquo; muttered the prince once more. &ldquo;She is very sensitive and easily put out, of course; but still, she...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is worthy of sympathy? Is that what you wished to say, my good fellow? But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of sympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and generous girl in her presence! This is a terrible exaggeration of sympathy! How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage? And you did propose to her, you know; you did so before her parents and sisters.</p></div> </div>
