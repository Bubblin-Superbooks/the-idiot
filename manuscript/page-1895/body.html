<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Can you be an honest man, prince, if you act so? I ask you! And did you not deceive that beautiful girl when you assured her of your love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are quite right. Oh! I feel that I am very guilty!&rdquo; said Muishkin, in deepest distress.</p><p>&ldquo;But as if that is enough!&rdquo; cried Evgenie, indignantly. &ldquo;As if it is enough simply to say: &lsquo;I know I am very guilty!&rsquo; You are to blame, and yet you persevere in evil-doing. Where was your heart, I should like to know, your christian heart, all that time? Did she look as though she were suffering less, at that moment? You saw her face&mdash;was she suffering less than the other woman? How could you see her suffering and allow it to continue? How could you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
