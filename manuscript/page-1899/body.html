<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall marry her&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why is it &lsquo;not the point&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it is not the point, not a bit. It makes no difference, my marrying her&mdash;it means nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How &lsquo;means nothing&rsquo;? You are talking nonsense, my friend. You are marrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness, and Aglaya sees and knows it. How can you say that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;not the point&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her happiness? Oh, no! I am only marrying her&mdash;well, because she wished it. It means nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same. She would certainly have died. I see now that that marriage with Rogojin was an insane idea. I understand all now that I did not understand before; and, do you know, when those two stood opposite to one another, I could not bear Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
