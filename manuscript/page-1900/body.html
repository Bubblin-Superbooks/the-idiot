You must know, Evgenie Pavlovitch, I have never told anyone before&mdash;not even Aglaya&mdash;that I cannot bear Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; (He lowered his voice mysteriously as he said this.) &ldquo;You described that evening at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s (six months since) very accurately just now; but there is one thing which you did not mention, and of which you took no account, because you do not know. I mean her face&mdash;I looked at her face, you see. Even in the morning when I saw her portrait, I felt that I could not bear to look at it. Now, there&rsquo;s Vera Lebedeff, for instance, her eyes are quite different, you know. I&rsquo;m afraid of her face!&rdquo; he added, with real alarm.</p></div> </div>
