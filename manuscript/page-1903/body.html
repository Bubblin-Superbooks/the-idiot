<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Without Aglaya&mdash;I&mdash;I must see Aglaya!&mdash;I shall die in my sleep very soon&mdash;I thought I was dying in my sleep last night. Oh! if Aglaya only knew all&mdash;I mean really, really all! Because she must know all&mdash;that&rsquo;s the first condition towards understanding. Why cannot we ever know all about another, especially when that other has been guilty? But I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about&mdash;I&rsquo;m so confused. You pained me so dreadfully. Surely&mdash;surely Aglaya has not the same expression now as she had at the moment when she ran away? Oh, yes! I am guilty and I know it&mdash;I know it! Probably I am in fault all round&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know how&mdash;but I am in fault, no doubt. There is something else, but I cannot explain it to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch. I have no words; but Aglaya will understand. I have always believed Aglaya will understand&mdash;I am assured she will.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
