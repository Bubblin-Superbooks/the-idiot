<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The prince did not die before his wedding&mdash;either by day or night, as he had foretold that he might. Very probably he passed disturbed nights, and was afflicted with bad dreams; but, during the daytime, among his fellow-men, he seemed as kind as ever, and even contented; only a little thoughtful when alone.</p><p>The wedding was hurried on. The day was fixed for exactly a week after Evgenie&rsquo;s visit to the prince. In the face of such haste as this, even the prince&rsquo;s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the hopelessness of any attempt to save &ldquo;the poor madman.&rdquo; Rumour said that in the visit of Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her husband... But if those good souls, in the boundless kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the eccentric young fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger measures to attain that end.</p></div> </div>
