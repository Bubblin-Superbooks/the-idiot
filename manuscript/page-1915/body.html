When he came to the prince&mdash;the very day before the wedding&mdash;to confess (for he always confessed to the persons against whom he intrigued, especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that he himself was a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had become simple Lebedeff. He then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince, interesting the latter exceedingly.</p><p>According to Lebedeff&rsquo;s account, he had first tried what he could do with General Epanchin. The latter informed him that he wished well to the unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to &ldquo;save him,&rdquo; but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere in this matter. Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him.</p></div> </div>
