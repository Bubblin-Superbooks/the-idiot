However, Lebedeff had not lost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,&mdash;a worthy and respectable man, whom he knew well. This old gentleman informed him that the thing was perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as to Muishkin&rsquo;s mental incapacity. Then, with the assistance of a few influential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged.</p><p>Lebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and carried the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as to whether the thing was to be done or not. The visit was not to be official, but merely friendly.</p></div> </div>
