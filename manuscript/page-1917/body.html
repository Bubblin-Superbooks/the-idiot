<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Muishkin remembered the doctor&rsquo;s visit quite well. He remembered that Lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at the bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had something to tell the prince about the sick man.</p><p>The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a conversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of Hippolyte&rsquo;s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of his own malady,&mdash;of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply was the old man interested by the prince&rsquo;s conversation and his description of Schneider&rsquo;s system, that he sat on for two hours.</p></div> </div>
