<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The prince had enough to do in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his visits.</p><p>A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte&rsquo;s mother came with tears in her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, &ldquo;or he would eat her up bodily.&rdquo; She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the invalid begged his visitor to &ldquo;beware of Rogojin.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
