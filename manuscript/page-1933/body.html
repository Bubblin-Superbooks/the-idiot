Nastasia Philipovna was ready at seven. From six o&rsquo;clock groups of people began to gather at Nastasia&rsquo;s house, at the prince&rsquo;s, and at the church door, but more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at seven.</p><p>Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the prince&rsquo;s account, but they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal feelings.</p></div> </div>
