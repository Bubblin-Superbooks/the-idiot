The windows of all the rooms occupied by Rogojin were closed, those of his mother&rsquo;s apartments were open. It was a hot, bright day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good look at the windows again; not only were Rogojin&rsquo;s closed, but the white blinds were all down as well.</p><p>He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and Rogojin&rsquo;s face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however, he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.</p></div> </div>
