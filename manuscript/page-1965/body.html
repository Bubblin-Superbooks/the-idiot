<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him&mdash;the prince&mdash;before long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here&mdash;he had no other town address&mdash;perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if all were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if all were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well with him. The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and rushed out towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.</p></div> </div>
