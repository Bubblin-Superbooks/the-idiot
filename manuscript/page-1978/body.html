The prince&rsquo;s heart beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in the deathly silence.</p><p>But now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he could distinguish the whole of the bed. Someone was asleep upon it&mdash;in an absolutely motionless sleep. Not the slightest movement was perceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard. The sleeper was covered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly distinguishable. He could only just make out that a human being lay outstretched there.</p><p>All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were scattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress, bits of lace, ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside glittered a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow.</p></div> </div>
