<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; interrupted the prince. &ldquo;I asked both the porter and the woman whether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes, and then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here. Last night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I thought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so secretly, but I was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe; she carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldn&rsquo;t rustle, and she held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldn&rsquo;t make a noise&mdash;it was you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the train, and she begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of taking her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.</p></div> </div>
