<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After each visit to Schneider&rsquo;s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter, besides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning the invalid&rsquo;s condition. In these letters is to be detected, and in each one more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and sympathy.</p><p>The individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who engages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff. We have never been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up. Of course the root of them was in the events which we have already recorded, and which so filled Vera with grief on the prince&rsquo;s account that she fell seriously ill. But exactly how the acquaintance and friendship came about, we cannot say.</p></div> </div>
