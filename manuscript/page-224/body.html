<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses around, day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he deserted her. She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over. She never had been pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;She was very quiet always&mdash;and I remember once, when she had suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said, &lsquo;Marie tried to sing today!&rsquo; and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after.</p></div> </div>
