The parson, a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon and pointed to Marie. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman&rsquo;&mdash;(which was a lie, because she had been ill for at least two years)&mdash;&lsquo;there she stands before you, and dares not lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is upon her. Look at her tatters and rags&mdash;the badge of those who lose their virtue. Who is she? her daughter!&rsquo; and so on to the end.</p><p>&ldquo;And just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only the children had altered&mdash;for then they were all on my side and had learned to love Marie.</p></div> </div>
