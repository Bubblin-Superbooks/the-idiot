H&rsquo;m! I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person,&rdquo; said the clerk, thoughtfully. &ldquo;At least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, in his history&mdash;but as an individual&mdash;one never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied the prince; &ldquo;there are none, except myself. I believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don&rsquo;t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
