Occasionally they stopped and listened; but they teased Marie all the same.</p><p>&ldquo;I told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got into the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed nothing from them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying &lsquo;Good-morning&rsquo; to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom there to salute anyone you meet with &lsquo;Good-morning&rsquo; whether acquainted or not. I can imagine how astonished Marie was at these first greetings from the children.</p></div> </div>
