<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Schneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious &lsquo;system&rsquo;; what nonsense that was! And what did he mean by my system? He said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself&mdash;just before I came away. &lsquo;You have the form and face of an adult&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but as regards soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are a child in the completest sense of the word, and always will be, if you live to be sixty.&rsquo; I laughed very much, for of course that is nonsense. But it is a fact that I do not care to be among grown-up people and much prefer the society of children. However kind people may be to me, I never feel quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back to my little companions. Now my companions have always been children, not because I was a child myself once, but because young things attract me.</p></div> </div>
