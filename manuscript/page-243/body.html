<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And then something so important happened, that Schneider himself urged me to depart. I am going to see now if can get good advice about it. Perhaps my lot in life will be changed; but that is not the principal thing. The principal thing is the entire change that has already come over me. I left many things behind me&mdash;too many. They have gone. On the journey I said to myself, &lsquo;I am going into the world of men. I don&rsquo;t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for me.&rsquo; I made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing my task. Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments, but I have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone; more cannot be asked of me. People may consider me a child if they like. I am often called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I was nearly as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now. How can I possibly be so when I know myself that I am considered one?</p></div> </div>
