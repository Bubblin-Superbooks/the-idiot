<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the train steamed out of the station, I saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and crying &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; till they were lost in the distance.</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces (I can read faces well) my heart felt light for the first time since that moment of parting. I think I must be one of those who are born to be in luck, for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step out of the railway carriage than I happen upon you!</p><p>&ldquo;I know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one&rsquo;s feelings before others; and yet here am I talking like this to you, and am not a bit ashamed or shy.</p></div> </div>
