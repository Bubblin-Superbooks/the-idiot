<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very likely not come to see you again for some time; but don&rsquo;t think the worse of me for that. It is not that I do not value your society; and you must never suppose that I have taken offence at anything.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked me about your faces, and what I could read in them; I will tell you with the greatest pleasure. You, Adelaida Ivanovna, have a very happy face; it is the most sympathetic of the three. Not to speak of your natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to one&rsquo;s self, &lsquo;She has the face of a kind sister.&rsquo; You are simple and merry, but you can see into another&rsquo;s heart very quickly. That&rsquo;s what I read in your face.</p></div> </div>
