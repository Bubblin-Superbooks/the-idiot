<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You too, Alexandra Ivanovna, have a very lovely face; but I think you may have some secret sorrow. Your heart is undoubtedly a kind, good one, but you are not merry. There is a certain suspicion of &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; in your face, like in that of Holbein&rsquo;s Madonna in Dresden. So much for your face. Have I guessed right?</p><p>&ldquo;As for your face, Lizabetha Prokofievna, I not only think, but am perfectly sure, that you are an absolute child&mdash;in all, in all, mind, both good and bad&mdash;and in spite of your years. Don&rsquo;t be angry with me for saying so; you know what my feelings for children are. And do not suppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. Oh dear no, it is by no means the case! Perhaps I have my own very profound object in view.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
