<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Stupid nonsense, and in a matter which ought to be approached with all candour and open-heartedness. There is a marriage being talked of, and I don&rsquo;t like this marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma, what are you saying?&rdquo; said Alexandra again, hurriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what, my dear girl? As if you can possibly like it yourself? The heart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbish&mdash;though one must have sense as well. Perhaps sense is really the great thing. Don&rsquo;t smile like that, Aglaya. I don&rsquo;t contradict myself. A fool with a heart and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I am one and you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of us are unhappy.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
