I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt&rsquo;s house, where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away. All honour to my respected father&rsquo;s memory&mdash;but he uncommonly nearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn&rsquo;t cut and run then, when I did, he&rsquo;d have murdered me like a dog.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you angered him somehow?&rdquo; asked the prince, looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that.</p></div> </div>
