There&rsquo;s a pen, a new one; do you mind a steel one? I have heard that you caligraphists don&rsquo;t like steel pens.&rdquo;</p><p>Conversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem to notice that Gania was in the room. But while the prince was getting his pen ready, finding a page, and making his preparations to write, Gania came up to the fireplace where Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince, and in trembling, broken accents said, almost in her ear:</p><p>&ldquo;One word, just one word from you, and I&rsquo;m saved.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
