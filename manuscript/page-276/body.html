<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Send me back then this one word of sympathy, only sympathy, I swear to you; and oh! do not be angry with the audacity of despair, with the drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to save himself from perishing beneath the waters.</p><p>&ldquo;G.L.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This man assures me,&rdquo; said Aglaya, scornfully, when the prince had finished reading the letter, &ldquo;that the words &lsquo;break off everything&rsquo; do not commit me to anything whatever; and himself gives me a written guarantee to that effect, in this letter. Observe how ingenuously he underlines certain words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts. He must know that if he &lsquo;broke off everything,&rsquo; first, by himself, and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my account, that in that case I should perhaps be able to change my opinion of him, and even accept his&mdash;friendship.</p></div> </div>
