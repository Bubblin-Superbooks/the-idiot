<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly, &ldquo;that though I once was so ill that I really was little better than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that, therefore, it is not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face. Of course your anger is excusable, considering the treatment you have just experienced; but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely. I do not like this sort of thing, and especially so at the first time of meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be at this moment standing at a crossroad, don&rsquo;t you think we had better part, you to the left, homewards, and I to the right, here? I have twenty-five roubles, and I shall easily find a lodging.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
