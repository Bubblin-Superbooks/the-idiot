<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The prince began to be a little incredulous.</p><p>&ldquo;I was passionately in love with her when she was engaged&mdash;engaged to my friend. The prince noticed the fact and was furious. He came and woke me at seven o&rsquo;clock one morning. I rise and dress in amazement; silence on both sides. I understand it all. He takes a couple of pistols out of his pocket&mdash;across a handkerchief&mdash;without witnesses. Why invite witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes? The pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one another. We aim the pistols at each other&rsquo;s hearts. Suddenly tears start to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we embrace&mdash;the battle is one of self-sacrifice now! The prince shouts, &lsquo;She is yours;&rsquo; I cry, &lsquo;She is yours&mdash;&rsquo; in a word, in a word&mdash;You&rsquo;ve come to live with us, hey?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
