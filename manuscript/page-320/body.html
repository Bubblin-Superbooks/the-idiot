He died in hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! it was the Kolpakoff business, and of course he would have been acquitted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes? Do you know that for a fact?&rdquo; asked the prince, whose curiosity was aroused by the general&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;I should think so indeed!&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;The court-martial came to no decision. It was a mysterious, an impossible business, one might say! Captain Larionoff, commander of the company, had died; his command was handed over to the prince for the moment. Very well. This soldier, Kolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to sell it, and spent the money on drink.</p></div> </div>
