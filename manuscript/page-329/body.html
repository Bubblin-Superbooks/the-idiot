<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You are still suspicious, I see, and do not believe me; but you may be quite at your ease. There shall be no more tears, nor questions&mdash;not from my side, at all events. All I wish is that you may be happy, you know that. I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be with you, whether we remain united, or whether we part. Of course I only answer for myself&mdash;you can hardly expect your sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My sister again,&rdquo; cried Gania, looking at her with contempt and almost hate. &ldquo;Look here, mother, I have already given you my word that I shall always respect you fully and absolutely, and so shall everyone else in this house, be it who it may, who shall cross this threshold.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
