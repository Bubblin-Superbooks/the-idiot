<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Practised hand&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was not going to express myself so. But how could you so blind her?&rdquo;</p><p>Nina Alexandrovna&rsquo;s question betrayed intense annoyance. Gania waited a moment and then said, without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of his tone:</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, mother, you are always like that. You begin by promising that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions, and here you are beginning them at once. We had better drop the subject&mdash;we had, really. I shall never leave you, mother; any other man would cut and run from such a sister as this. See how she is looking at me at this moment! Besides, how do you know that I am blinding Nastasia Philipovna? As for Varia, I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;she can do just as she pleases. There, that&rsquo;s quite enough!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
