He knew her at once from her photograph. Her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. She quickly pushed by him into the hall, shouldering him out of her way, and said, furiously, as she threw off her fur cloak:</p><p>&ldquo;If you are too lazy to mend your bell, you should at least wait in the hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. There, now, you&rsquo;ve dropped my fur cloak&mdash;dummy!&rdquo;</p><p>Sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. Nastasia had thrown it off her towards the prince, expecting him to catch it, but the prince had missed it.</p></div> </div>
