Next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each. &lsquo;Sell them,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.&rsquo; Well, I sold the bonds, but I didn&rsquo;t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at once to Zaleshoff&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
