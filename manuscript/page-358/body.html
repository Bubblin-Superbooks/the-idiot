<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I observed that the ladies were getting angry&mdash;over my cigar, doubtless. One looked at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.</p><p>&ldquo;I took no notice, because they never said a word. If they didn&rsquo;t like the cigar, why couldn&rsquo;t they say so? Not a word, not a hint! Suddenly, and without the very slightest suspicion of warning, &lsquo;light blue&rsquo; seizes my cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh! out of the window with it! Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young woman, tall and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me with flashing eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most refined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the poodle, took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it out of the window, after the cigar. The train went flying on, and the poodle&rsquo;s yells were lost in the distance.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
