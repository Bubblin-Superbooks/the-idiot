Why didn&rsquo;t I die there on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here now,&rsquo; I said, when we came out, &lsquo;none of your interference here after this&mdash;do you understand?&rsquo; He laughed: &lsquo;And how are you going to settle up with your father?&rsquo; says he.</p></div> </div>
