<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have met you somewhere, I believe, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Met me somewhere, pfu! Why, it&rsquo;s only three months since I lost two hundred roubles of my father&rsquo;s money to you, at cards. The old fellow died before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, I&rsquo;ve only to pull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and you&rsquo;d crawl on your hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; that&rsquo;s the sort of man you are. Why, I&rsquo;ve come now, at this moment, to buy you up! Oh, you needn&rsquo;t think that because I wear these boots I have no money. I have lots of money, my beauty,&mdash;enough to buy up you and all yours together. So I shall, if I like to! I&rsquo;ll buy you up! I will!&rdquo; he yelled, apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited.</p></div> </div>
