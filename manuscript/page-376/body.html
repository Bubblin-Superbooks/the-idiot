Ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by seven o&rsquo;clock tonight. Forty thousand roubles&mdash;paid down on the nail!&rdquo;</p><p>The scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia Philipovna continued to laugh and did not go away. Nina Alexandrovna and Varia had both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent horror, to see what would happen. Varia&rsquo;s eyes were all ablaze with anger; but the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She paled and trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well then, a hundred thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this very day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your fingers&mdash;come!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
