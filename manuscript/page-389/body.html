What do you think of Nastasia Philipovna? She is beautiful, isn&rsquo;t she? I had never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so. She fascinated me. I could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love, but for money! Oh dear! that is horrible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your brother does not attract me much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not surprised at that. After what you... But I do hate that way of looking at things! Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a fool, strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life, unless he wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg forgiveness on his knees! I think that so very absurd and tyrannical.</p></div> </div>
