Is he plaguing you, prince?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the least; on the contrary, he interests me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scolding as usual, Varia! It is the worst thing about her. After all, I believe father may have started off with Rogojin. No doubt he is sorry now. Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing,&rdquo; added Colia, running off.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another scene! Gania is worried&mdash;and ashamed&mdash;not without reason! What a spectacle! I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you if you knew Nastasia Philipovna before?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
