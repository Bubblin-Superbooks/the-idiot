I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I am. Don&rsquo;t say a word: I know what you want to tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your extraordinary confidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How so? What in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as good as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able to pocket the money. Of course, I know very little about it, but that&rsquo;s my view. When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife keeps the money in her own hands.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
