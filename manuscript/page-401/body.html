<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but, I assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have not spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There are uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isn&rsquo;t one honester than Ptitsin, he&rsquo;s the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You don&rsquo;t know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one myself I like you. Why am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They all call me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of thinking myself one. That&rsquo;s what is so bad about the business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I for one shall never think you a blackguard again,&rdquo; said the prince.</p></div> </div>
