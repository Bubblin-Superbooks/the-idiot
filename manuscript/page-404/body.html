You came to make friends with me again just now, and you said, &lsquo;I will kiss your hand, if you like,&rsquo; just as a child would have said it. And then, all at once you are talking of this mad project&mdash;of these seventy-five thousand roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what conclusion have you reached?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would do well to think it over again. It is more than possible that Varvara Ardalionovna is right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very well,&rdquo; replied Gania impatiently. &ldquo;That is proved by my having this conversation with you.</p></div> </div>
