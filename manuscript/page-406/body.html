<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In fifteen years people will say, &lsquo;Look, that&rsquo;s Ivolgin, the king of the Jews!&rsquo; You say that I have no originality. Now mark this, prince&mdash;there is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race than to be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak in character, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary person. You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a rogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now! You wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of selling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his part, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us! This has exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will do it! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man.</p></div> </div>
