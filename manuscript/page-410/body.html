<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner, thanks, Colia. I had too good a lunch at General Epanchin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Colia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the general and was carefully sealed up. It was clear from Colia&rsquo;s face how painful it was to him to deliver the missive. The prince read it, rose, and took his hat.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple of yards,&rdquo; said Colia, blushing.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting there over his bottle&mdash;and how they can give him credit, I cannot understand. Don&rsquo;t tell mother I brought you the note, prince; I have sworn not to do it a thousand times, but I&rsquo;m always so sorry for him. Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that end it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
