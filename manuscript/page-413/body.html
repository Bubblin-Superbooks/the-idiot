<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Colia took the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya, not far off. In one of the side rooms there sat at a table&mdash;looking like one of the regular guests of the establishment&mdash;Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a bottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee. He was waiting for the prince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long harangue about something or other; but so far gone was he that the prince could hardly understand a word.</p><p>&ldquo;I have not got a ten-rouble note,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;but here is a twenty-five. Change it and give me back the fifteen, or I shall be left without a farthing myself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
