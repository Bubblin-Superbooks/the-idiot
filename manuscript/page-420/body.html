And yet... well... you look as if you didn&rsquo;t believe me.... Well now, why should I not present the son of my old friend and companion to this delightful family&mdash;General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin? You will see a lovely girl&mdash;what am I saying&mdash;a lovely girl? No, indeed, two, three! Ornaments of this city and of society: beauty, education, culture&mdash;the woman question&mdash;poetry&mdash;everything! Added to which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least eighty thousand roubles. No bad thing, eh?... In a word I absolutely must introduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin. Tableau!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
