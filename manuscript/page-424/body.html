How disappointing! Would you believe it, I am always so unfortunate! May I most respectfully ask you to present my compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her... tell her, that with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for herself on Thursday evening, while she was listening to Chopin&rsquo;s Ballade. She will remember. I wish it with all sincerity. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin!&rdquo;</p><p>The woman&rsquo;s face changed; she lost her suspicious expression.</p></div> </div>
