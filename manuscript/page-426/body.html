Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Count on my assistance? Go alone?

To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock; that&rsquo;s how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me. &lsquo;Depend upon Ivolgin,&rsquo; said they all, &lsquo;he is as steady as a rock.&rsquo; But, excuse me, I must just call at a house on our way, a house where I have found consolation and help in all my trials for years.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
