Well, is Marfa Borisovna at home or have you only just come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no! I have been here a long while,&rdquo; replied Colia, who was at the front door when the general met him. &ldquo;I am keeping Hippolyte company. He is worse, and has been in bed all day. I came down to buy some cards. Marfa Borisovna expects you. But what a state you are in, father!&rdquo; added the boy, noticing his father&rsquo;s unsteady gait. &ldquo;Well, let us go in.&rdquo;</p><p>On meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though he made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible. He wanted Colia, but firmly resolved to leave the general behind. He could not forgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be of any use. The three climbed up the long staircase until they reached the fourth floor where Madame Terentieff lived.</p></div> </div>
