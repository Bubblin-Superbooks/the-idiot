<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:</p><p>&ldquo;I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
