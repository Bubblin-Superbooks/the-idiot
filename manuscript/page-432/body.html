General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin,&rdquo; stammered the disconcerted old man.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you believe,&rdquo; said the mistress of the house, suddenly addressing the prince, &ldquo;would you believe that that man has not even spared my orphan children? He has stolen everything I possessed, sold everything, pawned everything; he has left me nothing&mdash;nothing! What am I to do with your IOU&rsquo;s, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue? Answer, devourer! answer, heart of stone! How shall I feed my orphans? with what shall I nourish them? And now he has come, he is drunk! He can scarcely stand.
