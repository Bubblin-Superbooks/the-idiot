I pity him, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would laugh at me&mdash;but I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after all? Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last. Hippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity.

And then, you would hardly believe it, but my mother&mdash;Nina Alexandrovna&mdash;helps Hippolyte in all sorts of ways, sends him money and clothes.</p></div> </div>
