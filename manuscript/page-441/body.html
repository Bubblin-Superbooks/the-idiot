I think there is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in such circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Varia does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself airs. As to my mother, I really do admire her&mdash;yes, and honour her. Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and thought it vulgar of her&mdash;but now, he is sometimes quite touched and overcome by her kindness. H&rsquo;m! You call that being strong and good? I will remember that! Gania knows nothing about it. He would say that it was encouraging vice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
