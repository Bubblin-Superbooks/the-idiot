It seems there are many things that Gania does not know,&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, as he considered Colia&rsquo;s last words.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, I like you very much indeed, prince? I shall never forget about this afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like you too, Colia.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me! You are going to live here, are you not?&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;I mean to get something to do directly, and earn money. Then shall we three live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat, and let the general come and visit us. What do you say?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
