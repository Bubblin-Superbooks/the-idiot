And to this question he could fashion no satisfactory reply.</p><p>If only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia Philipovna and saying to her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ruin yourself by marrying this man. He does not love you, he only loves your money. He told me so himself, and so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn you&rdquo;&mdash;but even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing to do.</p></div> </div>
