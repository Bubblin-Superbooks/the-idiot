Neither his dirty boots, nor his wide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion of manner, produced the least impression upon her. She helped him off with his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while she announced him.</p><p>The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s consisted of none but her most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison with her usual gatherings on this anniversary.</p><p>In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin. They were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under a half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasia&rsquo;s deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public this evening.</p></div> </div>
