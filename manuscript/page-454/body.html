<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh general, spare Ferdishenko!&rdquo; replied the other, smiling. &ldquo;I have special privileges.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by special privileges?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Once before I had the honour of stating them to the company. I will repeat the explanation to-day for your excellency&rsquo;s benefit. You see, excellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself. I am neither. As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for it is a well-known fact that only stupid people tell &lsquo;the truth.&rsquo; Added to this, I am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever. If I am offended or injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring me meets with some misfortune. Then I remember, and take my revenge. I return the injury sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says. (Of course he never does so himself.)</p></div> </div>
