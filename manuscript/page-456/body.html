<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And I, your excellency, am the ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am of your opinion on that last point,&rdquo; said Ivan Fedorovitch, with ill-concealed irritation.</p><p>All this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was premeditated, but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to accept him as a buffoon.</p><p>&ldquo;If I am admitted and tolerated here,&rdquo; he had said one day, &ldquo;it is simply because I talk in this way. How can anyone possibly receive such a man as I am? I quite understand. Now, could I, a Ferdishenko, be allowed to sit shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy Ivanovitch? There is one explanation, only one. I am given the position because it is so entirely inconceivable!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
