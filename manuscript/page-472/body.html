So&mdash;then we are all ready; now prince, draw, please.&rdquo; The prince silently put his hand into the hat, and drew the names. Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then the general, Totski next, his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the ladies did not draw.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Ferdishenko. &ldquo;I did so hope the prince would come out first, and then the general. Well, gentlemen, I suppose I must set a good example! What vexes me much is that I am such an insignificant creature that it matters nothing to anybody whether I have done bad actions or not! Besides, which am I to choose? It&rsquo;s an embarras de richesse. Shall I tell how I became a thief on one occasion only, to convince Afanasy Ivanovitch that it is possible to steal without being a thief?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
