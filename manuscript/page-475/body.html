Were I as witty, now, as Mr. Totski or the general, I should probably have sat silent all the evening, as they have. Now, prince, what do you think?&mdash;are there not far more thieves than honest men in this world? Don&rsquo;t you think we may say there does not exist a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything whatever in his life?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a silly idea,&rdquo; said the actress. &ldquo;Of course it is not the case. I have never stolen anything, for one.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
