<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I arrived at the old woman&rsquo;s house beside myself. She was sitting in a corner all alone, leaning her face on her hand. I fell on her like a clap of thunder. &lsquo;You old wretch!&rsquo; I yelled and all that sort of thing, in real Russian style. Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange thing happened. I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes starting out of her head, but she did not say a word. She seemed to sway about as she sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest way. Well, I soon stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her questions, but not a word could I get out of her. The flies were buzzing about the room and only this sound broke the silence; the sun was setting outside; I didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it, so I went away.</p></div> </div>
