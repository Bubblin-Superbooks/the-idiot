<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Before I reached home I was met and summoned to the major&rsquo;s, so that it was some while before I actually got there. When I came in, Nikifor met me. &lsquo;Have you heard, sir, that our old lady is dead?&rsquo; &lsquo;dead, when?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, an hour and a half ago.&rsquo; That meant nothing more nor less than that she was dying at the moment when I pounced on her and began abusing her.</p><p>&ldquo;This produced a great effect upon me. I used to dream of the poor old woman at nights. I really am not superstitious, but two days after, I went to her funeral, and as time went on I thought more and more about her. I said to myself, &lsquo;This woman, this human being, lived to a great age.</p></div> </div>
