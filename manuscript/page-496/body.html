I waited there till dawn, and soon after six I was off, and at the old merchant Trepalaf&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Camellias!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;father, save me, save me, let me have some camellias!&rsquo; He was a tall, grey old man&mdash;a terrible-looking old gentleman. &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Down I went on my knees. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, don&rsquo;t&mdash;think what you&rsquo;re doing!&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a matter of life and death!&rsquo; &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, take them,&rsquo; says he. So up I get, and cut such a bouquet of red camellias! He had a whole greenhouse full of them&mdash;lovely ones. The old fellow sighs. I pull out a hundred roubles. &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t insult me that way.</p></div> </div>
