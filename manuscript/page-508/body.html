<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Katia, the maid-servant, made her appearance, terribly frightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodness knows what it means, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is a whole collection of men come&mdash;all tipsy&mdash;and want to see you. They say that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Rogojin, and she knows all about it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Katia, let them all in at once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Surely not all, ma&rsquo;am? They seem so disorderly&mdash;it&rsquo;s dreadful to see them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes all, Katia, all&mdash;every one of them. Let them in, or they&rsquo;ll come in whether you like or no. Listen! what a noise they are making! Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your presence? I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it cannot be helped&mdash;and I should be very grateful if you could all stay and witness this climax. However, just as you please, of course.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
