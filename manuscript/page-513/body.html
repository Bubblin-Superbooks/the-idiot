I mean mad in the medical sense of the word .... eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said she was predisposed to it,&rdquo; whispered Afanasy Ivanovitch slyly. &ldquo;Perhaps it is a fever!&rdquo;</p><p>Since their visit to Gania&rsquo;s home, Rogojin&rsquo;s followers had been increased by two new recruits&mdash;a dissolute old man, the hero of some ancient scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant. A laughable story was told of the former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth, and one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them, and was never able to reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival of the gentleman who was so proud of his fists.</p></div> </div>
