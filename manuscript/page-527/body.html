What dreadful things you are saying,&rdquo; cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief.</p><p>&ldquo;I am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you know&mdash;it&rsquo;s my birthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias, sitting there laughing at us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my attention,&rdquo; said Totski, with dignity.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free? Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to be&mdash;nothing particular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept me like a countess.</p></div> </div>
