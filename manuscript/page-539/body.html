All I do know is that Paparchin was a very rich merchant indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. &ldquo;Hurrah for the last of the Muishkins!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as though he were a beggar,&rdquo; blurted out the general, half senseless with amazement. &ldquo;Well, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!&rdquo; And the general rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince.
