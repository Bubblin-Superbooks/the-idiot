Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very proud, in spite of what I am,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You called me &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast of the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you, after all I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really and truly thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I should consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown in for a husband, a paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand back, sir; you did not reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better dash than you did. I&rsquo;ll console Gania myself; I have an idea about that.</p></div> </div>
