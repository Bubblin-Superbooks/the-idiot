Your bride is accepting money. What a disreputable woman she must be! And you wished to marry her! What are you crying about? Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you shall laugh yet. Trust to time.&rdquo; (In spite of these words there were two large tears rolling down Nastasia&rsquo;s own cheeks.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far better to think twice of it now than afterwards. Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t cry like that! There&rsquo;s Katia crying, too. What is it, Katia, dear? I shall leave you and Pasha a lot of things, I&rsquo;ve laid them out for you already; but good-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like myself. It&rsquo;s better so, prince, it is indeed. You&rsquo;d begin to despise me afterwards&mdash;we should never be happy.</p></div> </div>
