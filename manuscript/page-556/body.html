No, no; we&rsquo;d better say good-bye and part friends. I am a bit of a dreamer myself, and I used to dream of you once. Very often during those five years down at his estate I used to dream and think, and I always imagined just such a good, honest, foolish fellow as you, one who should come and say to me: &lsquo;You are an innocent woman, Nastasia Philipovna, and I adore you.&rsquo; I dreamt of you often. I used to think so much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would come down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to drown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do it. I hadn&rsquo;t the heart, and now&mdash;well, are you ready, Rogojin?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
