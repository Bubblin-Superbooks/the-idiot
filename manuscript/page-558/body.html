<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands into the fire and pick it out&mdash;without gloves, you know. You must have bare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up. Pull it out, I say, and it&rsquo;s all yours. You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then it&rsquo;s a hundred thousand roubles, remember&mdash;it won&rsquo;t take you long to lay hold of it and snatch it out. I shall so much admire you if you put your hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be witnesses that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If you don&rsquo;t get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come; away&mdash;get away, all of you&mdash;it&rsquo;s my money! Rogojin has bought me with it. Is it my money, Rogojin?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
