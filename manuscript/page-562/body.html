<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My lady! my sovereign!&rdquo; lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself, I saw the money! My queen, let me get into the fire after it&mdash;say the word&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor lame wife and thirteen children. My father died of starvation last week. Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; The wretched little man wept, and groaned, and crawled towards the fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Away, out of the way!&rdquo; cried Nastasia. &ldquo;Make room, all of you! Gania, what are you standing there for? Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony. Put in your hand! There&rsquo;s your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
