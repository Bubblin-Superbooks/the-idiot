I have quite another matter on hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to think&mdash;but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. &ldquo;No, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion.
