<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that the fact of Gania&rsquo;s retirement from business was the ultimate cause of the marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his family, but even required help himself.</p><p>We may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin household any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance in connection with the fatal evening at Nastasia&rsquo;s house became known to the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. This fact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to bed. He had awaited the prince&rsquo;s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish impatience.</p></div> </div>
