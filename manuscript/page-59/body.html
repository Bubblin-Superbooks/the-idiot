I&rsquo;d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You see, I&rsquo;m used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven&rsquo;t had a puff for three hours; however, just as you like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?&rdquo; muttered the servant. &ldquo;In the first place, you&rsquo;ve no right in here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because you&rsquo;re a sort of visitor&mdash;a guest, in fact&mdash;and I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?&rdquo; he added, glancing once more at the prince&rsquo;s bundle, which evidently gave him no peace.</p></div> </div>
