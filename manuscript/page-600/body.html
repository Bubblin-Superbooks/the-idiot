<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Once you did me the honour of giving me your confidence. Perhaps you have quite forgotten me now! How is it that I am writing to you? I do not know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of my existence, especially you. How many times I have needed all three of you; but only you have dwelt always in my mind&rsquo;s eye. I need you&mdash;I need you very much. I will not write about myself. I have nothing to tell you. But I long for you to be happy. Are you happy? That is all I wished to say to you&mdash;Your brother,</p><p>&ldquo;Pr. L. Muishkin.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
