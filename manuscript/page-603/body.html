Keep well&mdash;Ever your loving,</p><p>&ldquo;Pr. L. Muishkin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,&rdquo; said Aglaya, as she returned the note, and walked past the &ldquo;pepper-box&rdquo; with an expression of great contempt.</p><p>This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania&rsquo;s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified.</p></div> </div>
