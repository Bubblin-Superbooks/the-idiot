<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What&mdash;you&rsquo;re a relation then, are you?&rdquo; asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough. If I am received&mdash;very good; if not, well, very good again. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
