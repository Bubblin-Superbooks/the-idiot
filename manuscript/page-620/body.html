Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have paid!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;As to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it because he beat you. He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the service, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojin&rsquo;s followers. They are all lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off. Of course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a card-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last rouble.</p></div> </div>
