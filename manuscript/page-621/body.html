<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To tell the truth, I thought to myself, &lsquo;If I lose, I will go to my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.&rsquo; Now that was base&mdash;cowardly and base!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; observed Lebedeff quietly; &ldquo;cowardly and base.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph,&rdquo; said the nephew viciously; for the words seemed to irritate him. &ldquo;He is delighted! I came to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did not excuse myself. I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone here can witness. But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new post, for I am really like a tramp. Just look at my boots! I cannot possibly appear like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time appointed, the job will be given to someone else; and I shall have to try for another.</p></div> </div>
