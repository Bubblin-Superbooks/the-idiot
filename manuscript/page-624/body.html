<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will say you are quite wrong, if you wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I wish! That&rsquo;s good, I must say! Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct? I am quite aware that his money is his own, and that my action&mdash;is much like an attempt at extortion. But you-you don&rsquo;t know what life is! If people don&rsquo;t learn by experience, they never understand. They must be taught. My intentions are perfectly honest; on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will pay back the money with interest. Added to which he has had the moral satisfaction of seeing me disgraced. What does he want more? and what is he good for if he never helps anyone? Look what he does himself! just ask him about his dealings with others, how he deceives people! How did he manage to buy this house? You may cut off my head if he has not let you in for something&mdash;</p></div> </div>
