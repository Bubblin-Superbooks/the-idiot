<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That man who appears in court for scoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate, banging his head on the ground by the half-hour&mdash;and for whom do you think he prays? Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions? I have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul of the Countess du Barry! Colia heard it too. He is as mad as a March hare!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You hear how he slanders me, prince,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, almost beside himself with rage. &ldquo;I may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at least I can say one thing for myself. He does not know&mdash;how should he, mocker that he is?&mdash;that when he came into the world it was I who washed him, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia had lost her husband, and was in great poverty.</p></div> </div>
