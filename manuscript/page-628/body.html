An Empress wrote to her, with her own hand, as &lsquo;Ma ch√®re cousine.&rsquo; At a lever-du-roi one morning (do you know what a lever-du-roi was?)&mdash;a Cardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour! Did you know this? I see by your expression that you did not! Well, how did she die? Answer!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! do stop&mdash;you are too absurd!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is how she died. After all this honour and glory, after having been almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson. She was quite innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the fishwives of Paris. She was so terrified, that she did not understand what was happening.</p></div> </div>
