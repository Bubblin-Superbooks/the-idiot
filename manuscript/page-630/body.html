<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I said, &lsquo;Oh Lord! give rest to the soul of that great sinner, the Comtesse du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.&rsquo; You see that is quite a different thing, for how many sinners there are, how many women, who have passed through the trials of this life, are now suffering and groaning in purgatory! I prayed for you, too, in spite of your insolence and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that you claim to know how I pray...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s enough in all conscience! Pray for whom you choose, and the devil take them and you! We have a scholar here; you did not know that, prince?&rdquo; he continued, with a sneer. &ldquo;He reads all sorts of books and memoirs now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
