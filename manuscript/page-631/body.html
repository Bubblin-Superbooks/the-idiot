<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;At any rate, your uncle has a kind heart,&rdquo; remarked the prince, who really had to force himself to speak to the nephew, so much did he dislike him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, now you are going to praise him! He will be set up! He puts his hand on his heart, and he is delighted! I never said he was a man without heart, but he is a rascal&mdash;that&rsquo;s the pity of it. And then, he is addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most people who have taken more than is good for them for years. He loves his children&mdash;oh, I know that well enough! He respected my aunt, his late wife... and he even has a sort of affection for me. He has remembered me in his will.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
