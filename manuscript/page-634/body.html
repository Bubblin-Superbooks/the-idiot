Oh I if only I knew where Colia was at this moment!&rdquo; cried the prince, standing up, as if to go.</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell you all about Colia,&rdquo; said the young man</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! no, no!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, hurriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Colia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father, whom you let out of prison by paying his debts&mdash;Heaven only knows why!
