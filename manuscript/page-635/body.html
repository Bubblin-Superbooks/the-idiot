He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!&rdquo; interrupted Lebedeff.... &ldquo;But come&mdash;let us go into the garden&mdash;we will have coffee there....&rdquo; And Lebedeff seized the prince&rsquo;s arm, and led him from the room. They went across the yard, and found themselves in a delightful little garden with the trees already in their summer dress of green, thanks to the unusually fine weather. Lebedeff invited his guest to sit down on a green seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth, and took a seat facing him. In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the prince did not refuse it. The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin, with an expression of passionate servility.</p></div> </div>
