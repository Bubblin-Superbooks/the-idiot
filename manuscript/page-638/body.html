Tell me, is it a fact that she left him while they were in Moscow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a fact, and this time, let me tell you, on the very eve of their marriage! It was a question of minutes when she slipped off to Petersburg. She came to me directly she arrived&mdash;&lsquo;Save me, Lukian! find me some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!&rsquo; She is afraid of you, even more than she is of him, and in that she shows her wisdom!&rdquo; And Lebedeff slily put his finger to his brow as he said the last words.</p></div> </div>
