He had no idea that his heart could beat so painfully.</p><p>One house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before he reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said to himself: &ldquo;That is the house, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; He came up to it quite curious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he would be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so. The house was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest claim to architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green. There are a few of these old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still standing in that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change from their original form and colour.</p></div> </div>
