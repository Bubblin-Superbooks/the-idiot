<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know yourself it does not depend on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Parfen, I am not your enemy, and I do not intend to oppose your intentions in any way. I repeat this to you now just as I said it to you once before on a very similar occasion. When you were arranging for your projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with you&mdash;you know I did not. That first time she fled to me from you, from the very altar almost, and begged me to &lsquo;save her from you.&rsquo; Afterwards she ran away from me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with her once more; and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to Petersburg. Is it true? Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and that&rsquo;s why I came here. That you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia Philipovna I only learned last night in the train from a friend of yours, Zaleshoff&mdash;if you wish to know.</p></div> </div>
