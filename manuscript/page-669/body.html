Both were silent for a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;When you are not with me I hate you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I have loathed you every day of these three months since I last saw you. By heaven I have!&rdquo; said Rogojin. &ldquo;I could have poisoned you at any minute. Now, you have been with me but a quarter of an hour, and all my malice seems to have melted away, and you are as dear to me as ever. Stay here a little longer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
