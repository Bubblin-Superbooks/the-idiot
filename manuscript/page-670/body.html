I quite understand that you and I cannot be put on a level, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you add that?&mdash;There! Now you are cross again,&rdquo; said the prince, wondering.</p><p>&ldquo;We were not asked, you see. We were made different, with different tastes and feelings, without being consulted. You say you love her with pity. I have no pity for her. She hates me&mdash;that&rsquo;s the plain truth of the matter. I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing at me with another man. And so she does laugh at me. She thinks no more of marrying me than if she were changing her shoe.</p></div> </div>
