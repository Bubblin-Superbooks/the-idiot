I knelt at her feet: &lsquo;I shall die here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t forgive me; and if you have me turned out, I shall drown myself; because, what should I be without you now?&rsquo; She was like a madwoman all that day; now she would cry; now she would threaten me with a knife; now she would abuse me. She called in Zaleshoff and Keller, and showed me to them, shamed me in their presence. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s all go to the theatre,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and leave him here if he won&rsquo;t go&mdash;it&rsquo;s not my business. They&rsquo;ll give you some tea, Parfen Semeonovitch, while I am away, for you must be hungry.&rsquo; She came back from the theatre alone. &lsquo;Those cowards wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They are afraid of you, and tried to frighten me, too.</p></div> </div>
