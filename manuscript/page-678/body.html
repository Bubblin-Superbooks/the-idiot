<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t marry you. I&rsquo;ve said it. Surely you haven&rsquo;t sat in this chair all night without sleeping?&rsquo; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;H&rsquo;m! how sensible of you. And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?&rsquo; &lsquo;I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t. Forgive me!&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how unbecoming this sort of thing is to you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s like putting a saddle on a cow&rsquo;s back. Do you think you are frightening me? My word, what a dreadful thing that you should sit here and eat no food! How terribly frightened I am!&rsquo; She wasn&rsquo;t angry long, and didn&rsquo;t seem to remember my offence at all. I was surprised, for she is a vindictive, resentful woman&mdash;but then I thought that perhaps she despised me too much to feel any resentment against me. And that&rsquo;s the truth.</p></div> </div>
