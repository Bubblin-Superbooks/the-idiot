You must know there was a Roman Pope once, and he was very angry with a certain Emperor; so the Emperor came and neither ate nor drank, but knelt before the Pope&rsquo;s palace till he should be forgiven. And what sort of vows do you think that Emperor was making during all those days on his knees? Stop, I&rsquo;ll read it to you!&rsquo; Then she read me a lot of verses, where it said that the Emperor spent all the time vowing vengeance against the Pope. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you don&rsquo;t approve of the poem, Parfen Semeonovitch,&rsquo; she says.</p></div> </div>
