And you are making vows to yourself that if I marry you, you will remind me of all this, and take it out of me.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;perhaps I was thinking like that, and perhaps I was not. I&rsquo;m not thinking of anything just now.&rsquo; &lsquo;What are your thoughts, then?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that when you rise from your chair and go past me, I watch you, and follow you with my eyes; if your dress does but rustle, my heart sinks; if you leave the room, I remember every little word and action, and what your voice sounded like, and what you said. I thought of nothing all last night, but sat here listening to your sleeping breath, and heard you move a little, twice.</p></div> </div>
