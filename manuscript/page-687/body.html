She looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d be just such another,&rsquo; she said at last, and laughed. &lsquo;You have such strong passions, Parfen,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that they&rsquo;d have taken you to Siberia in no time if you had not, luckily, intelligence as well. For you have a good deal of intelligence.&rsquo; (She said this&mdash;believe it or not. The first time I ever heard anything of that sort from her.)</p></div> </div>
