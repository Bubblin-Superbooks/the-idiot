Why, she always acts as though she were in a delirium now-a-days! Either she says, &lsquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll marry you! Let&rsquo;s have the wedding quickly!&rsquo; and fixes the day, and seems in a hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels frightened; or else some other idea gets into her head&mdash;goodness knows! you&rsquo;ve seen her&mdash;you know how she goes on&mdash;laughing and crying and raving! There&rsquo;s nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you! She ran away because she found out how dearly she loved you. She could not bear to be near you. You said just now that I had found her at Moscow, when she ran away from you. I didn&rsquo;t do anything of the sort; she came to me herself, straight from you.</p></div> </div>
