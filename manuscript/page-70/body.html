<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Of course not&mdash;of course not!&mdash;bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you&mdash;believe it or not, as you like&mdash;that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he cried, he did indeed,&mdash;he was as white as a bit of paper. Isn&rsquo;t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried&mdash;cried! Whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear&mdash;not a child, but a man who never had cried before&mdash;a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what must have been going on in that man&rsquo;s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that&rsquo;s what it is. Because it is said &lsquo;thou shalt not kill,&rsquo; is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it&rsquo;s an impossible theory.</p></div> </div>
