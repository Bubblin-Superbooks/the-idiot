One morning I met a man in the train, and made acquaintance with him at once. I had often heard of him as a very learned man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of conversing with so eminent and clever a person. He doesn&rsquo;t believe in God, and he talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared to me that he was speaking outside the subject.
