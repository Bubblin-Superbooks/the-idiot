<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I told him this, but I dare say I did not clearly express what I meant, for he could not understand me.</p><p>&ldquo;That same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so happened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night before, and everybody was talking about it. Two peasants&mdash;elderly men and old friends&mdash;had had tea together there the night before, and were to occupy the same bedroom. They were not drunk but one of them had noticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch which he was wearing on a chain. He was by no means a thief, and was, as peasants go, a rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he could not restrain himself. He took a knife, and when his friend turned his back, he came up softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed himself, and saying earnestly&mdash;&lsquo;God forgive me, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; he cut his friend&rsquo;s throat like a sheep, and took the watch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
