<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He came up to me and said, &lsquo;Buy my silver cross, sir! You shall have it for fourpence&mdash;it&rsquo;s real silver.&rsquo; I looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own neck, evidently, a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern. I fished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see by his face that he was as pleased as he could be at the thought that he had succeeded in cheating a foolish gentleman, and away he went to drink the value of his cross. At that time everything that I saw made a tremendous impression upon me. I had understood nothing about Russia before, and had only vague and fantastic memories of it. So I thought, &lsquo;I will wait awhile before I condemn this Judas. Only God knows what may be hidden in the hearts of drunkards.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
