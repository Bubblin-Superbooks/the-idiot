Now with the rack and tortures and so on&mdash;you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until you die. But here I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all&mdash;but the certain knowledge that in an hour,&mdash;then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now&mdash;this very instant&mdash;your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man&mdash;</p></div> </div>
