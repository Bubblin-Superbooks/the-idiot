<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In early summer there are often magnificent days in St. Petersburg&mdash;bright, hot and still. This happened to be such a day.</p><p>For some time the prince wandered about without aim or object. He did not know the town well. He stopped to look about him on bridges, at street corners. He entered a confectioner&rsquo;s shop to rest, once. He was in a state of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing and no one; and he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his thoughts and his emotions, and to give himself up to them passively. He loathed the idea of trying to answer the questions that would rise up in his heart and mind. &ldquo;I am not to blame for all this,&rdquo; he thought to himself, half unconsciously.</p></div> </div>
