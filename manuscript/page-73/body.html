Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head&mdash;then&mdash;that quarter of a second is the most awful of all.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not my own fantastical opinion&mdash;many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death.</p></div> </div>
