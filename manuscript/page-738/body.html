He said he did not love her with sympathy and pity; true, he added that &ldquo;your pity is greater than my love,&rdquo; but he was not quite fair on himself there. Kin! Rogojin reading a book&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t that sympathy beginning? Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her? And his story of waiting day and night for her forgiveness? That didn&rsquo;t look quite like passion alone.</p><p>And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion? Could her face inspire passion at all now? Oh, it inspired suffering, grief, overwhelming grief of the soul! A poignant, agonizing memory swept over the prince&rsquo;s heart.</p></div> </div>
