<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy&mdash;at all events hoping on in some degree&mdash;even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope&mdash;having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,&mdash;is taken away from the wretch and certainty substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death&mdash;which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon&rsquo;s mouth in battle, and fire upon him&mdash;and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears.</p></div> </div>
