Why, this is the street, and here&rsquo;s the house, No. 16.</p><p>The prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna. The lady of the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with Daria Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days.</p><p>Madame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and crafty, piercing eyes. When, with an air of mystery, she asked her visitor&rsquo;s name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he changed his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given to Nastasia Philipovna. The urgency of his request seemed to impress Madame Filisoff, and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say, &ldquo;You need not be afraid, I quite understand.&rdquo; The prince&rsquo;s name evidently was a great surprise to her.</p></div> </div>
