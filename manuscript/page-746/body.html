<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Was there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient to justify the prince&rsquo;s terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon? Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful presentiments? Yes, he was convinced of it&mdash;convinced of what? (Oh, how mean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment! How he blamed himself for it!) &ldquo;Speak if you dare, and tell me, what is the presentiment?&rdquo; he repeated to himself, over and over again. &ldquo;Put it into words, speak out clearly and distinctly. Oh, miserable coward that I am!&rdquo; The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness. &ldquo;How shall I ever look this man in the face again? My God, what a day! And what a nightmare, what a nightmare!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
