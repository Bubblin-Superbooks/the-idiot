<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lebedeff&rsquo;s country-house was not large, but it was pretty and convenient, especially the part which was let to the prince.</p><p>A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs, stood on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees gave the house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought it, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to their number. When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the villa and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the street to enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the rent to be demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound.</p></div> </div>
