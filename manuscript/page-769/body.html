Then, satisfied that he had worked up Muishkin&rsquo;s curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly: &ldquo;She is afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.&rdquo;</p><p>The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them away, too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very minute,&rdquo; said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and waving his hands as he ran from door to door.</p></div> </div>
