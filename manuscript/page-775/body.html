He had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the Epanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had spent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago. Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the opportunity of meeting him again.</p><p>The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie Pavlovitch arrived.</p><p>It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchins&rsquo; house to Lebedeff&rsquo;s. The first disagreeable impression experienced by Mrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of other guests&mdash;not to mention the fact that some of those present were particularly detestable in her eyes.</p></div> </div>
