<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A device&mdash;A. N. B.&mdash;the meaning of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, A. N. D.,&rdquo; corrected Colia.</p><p>&ldquo;I say A. N. B., and so it shall be!&rdquo; cried Aglaya, irritably. &ldquo;Anyway, the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she might say or do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her just the same.</p></div> </div>
