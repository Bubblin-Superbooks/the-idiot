She continued to recite:</p><p>&ldquo;Once there came a vision glorious, Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair; Burned itself into his spirit, And abode for ever there! &ldquo;Never more&mdash;from that sweet moment&mdash; Gaz√©d he on womankind; He was dumb to love and wooing And to all their graces blind. &ldquo;Full of love for that sweet vision, Brave and pure he took the field; With his blood he stained the letters N. P. B. upon his shield. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!&rsquo; Shouting on the foe he fell, And like thunder rang his war-cry O&rsquo;er the cowering infidel.</p></div> </div>
