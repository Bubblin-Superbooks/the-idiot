<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done for him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone to P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom P&mdash;&mdash; interested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a father. If I wished to behave nobly, justly, and with delicacy, I ought to bestow half my fortune upon the son of my benefactor; but as economy is my favourite virtue, and I know this is not a case in which the law can intervene, I will not give up half my millions. But it would be too openly vile, too flagrantly infamous, if I did not at least restore to P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s son the tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy. This is simply a case of conscience and of strict justice.</p></div> </div>
