What?&rdquo; cried all the visitors at once, in violent agitation.</p><p>&ldquo;As to the article,&rdquo; said Hippolyte in his croaking voice, &ldquo;I have told you already that we none of us approve of it! There is the writer,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him. &ldquo;I quite admit that he has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard for style and decency. I know he is a cross between a fool and an adventurer; I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day. But after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of every man; consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted. Let him answer for his own blunders.</p></div> </div>
