We do not care who your witnesses may be, or whether they are your friends or not. As they cannot fail to recognize Burdovsky&rsquo;s right (seeing that it is mathematically demonstrable), it is just as well that the witnesses should be your friends. The truth will only be more plainly evident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is quite true; we had agreed upon that point,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, in confirmation.</p></div> </div>
