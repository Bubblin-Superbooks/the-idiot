<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But the main point is&mdash;listen, gentlemen, let me finish!&mdash;the main point is that Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son at all. Gavrila Ardalionovitch has just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive proofs. Well, what do you think of that? It is scarcely credible, even after all the tricks that have been played upon me. Please note that we have positive proofs! I can hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I do not yet believe it; I am still doubtful, because Gavrila Ardalionovitch has not had time to go into details; but there can be no further doubt that Tchebaroff is a rogue! He has deceived poor Mr. Burdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your friend&mdash;(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!).</p></div> </div>
