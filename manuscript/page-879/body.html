<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He has abused your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all is said and done this claim is nothing else!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son? Impossible!&rdquo;</p><p>These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into which the prince&rsquo;s words had plunged Burdovsky&rsquo;s companions.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly it is a fraud! Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son, his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been deceived. I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter.</p></div> </div>
