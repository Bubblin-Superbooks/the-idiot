<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In my opinion this is most important. I may add that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my detective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,&mdash;it was thanks to him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special teachers&mdash;his relations and servants grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point out that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years of Pavlicheff&rsquo;s life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your mother&rsquo;s acquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports.</p></div> </div>
