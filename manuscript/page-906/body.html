Wait a moment &lsquo;till I thank the prince! Thank you, prince, for the entertainment you have given us! It was most amusing to hear these young men... It is vile, vile!

Don&rsquo;t fuss round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you exasperate me! So, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, addressing the prince, &ldquo;you go so far as to beg their pardon! He says, &lsquo;Forgive me for offering you a fortune.&rsquo; And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?&rdquo; she cried, turning suddenly on Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew.</p></div> </div>
