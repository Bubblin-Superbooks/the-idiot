<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;No, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you said yourself just now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it quite natural that a man should murder six people because he was in misery, the world must be coming to an end. I had not heard of it before. Now I understand everything. And this stutterer, won&rsquo;t he turn out a murderer?&rdquo; she cried, pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at her with stupefaction. &ldquo;I bet he will! He will have none of your money, possibly, he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him to accept it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off with your cashbox, with a clear conscience! He does not call it a dishonest action but &lsquo;the impulse of a noble despair&rsquo;; &lsquo;a negation&rsquo;; or the devil knows what! Bah! everything is upside down, everyone walks head downwards.</p></div> </div>
