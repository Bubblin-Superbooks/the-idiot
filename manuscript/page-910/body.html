<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A young girl, brought up at home, suddenly jumps into a cab in the middle of the street, saying: &lsquo;Good-bye, mother, I married Karlitch, or Ivanitch, the other day!&rsquo; And you think it quite right? You call such conduct estimable and natural? The &lsquo;woman question&rsquo;? Look here,&rdquo; she continued, pointing to Colia, &ldquo;the other day that whippersnapper told me that this was the whole meaning of the &lsquo;woman question.&rsquo; But even supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none the less, bound to treat her with humanity. Why did you come here tonight so insolently? &lsquo;Give us our rights, but don&rsquo;t dare to speak in our presence. Show us every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you like the scum of the earth.</p></div> </div>
