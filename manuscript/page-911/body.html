<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rsquo; The miscreants have written a tissue of calumny in their article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and do battle for the right! &lsquo;We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no thanks from us, because you will be acting to satisfy your own conscience!&rsquo; What morality! But, good heavens! if you declare that the prince&rsquo;s generosity will, excite no gratitude in you, he might answer that he is not, bound to be grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only satisfying his own conscience. But you counted on the prince&rsquo;s, gratitude towards Pavlicheff; you never lent him any money; he owes you nothing; then what were you counting upon if not on his gratitude? And if you appeal to that sentiment in others, why should you expect to be exempted from it? They are mad! They say society is savage and inhuman because it despises a young girl who has been seduced.</p></div> </div>
