I think you wanted to take the prince home with you for tea. Stay here, and let us spend the evening together. I am sure the prince will give us all some tea. Forgive me for being so free and easy&mdash;but I know you are kind, and the prince is kind, too. In fact, we are all good-natured people&mdash;it is really quite comical.&rdquo;</p><p>The prince bestirred himself to give orders. Lebedeff hurried out, followed by Vera.</p><p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin decisively. &ldquo;Talk, but not too loud, and don&rsquo;t excite yourself. You have made me sorry for you.</p></div> </div>
