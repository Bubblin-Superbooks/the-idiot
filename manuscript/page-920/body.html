<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Prince, you don&rsquo;t deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet I will, all the same, but I won&rsquo;t apologize. I apologize to nobody! Nobody! It is absurd! However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you up&mdash;that is, if you like, of course. But please don&rsquo;t let me keep anyone,&rdquo; she added suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of resentment, as though they had grievously offended her. &ldquo;I can come home alone quite well.&rdquo;</p><p>But they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly. The prince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized for not having thought of it before. The general murmured a few polite words, and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the terrace.</p></div> </div>
