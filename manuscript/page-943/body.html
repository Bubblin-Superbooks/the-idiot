The gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness.</p><p>&ldquo;I can but thank you,&rdquo; he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere, &ldquo;for your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that our Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own, and immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
