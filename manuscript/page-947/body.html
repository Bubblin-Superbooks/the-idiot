<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was saying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night. Do you know what you fear most? You fear our sincerity more than anything, although you despise us! The idea crossed my mind that night... You thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna? No, the idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you. Colia told me the prince called you a child&mdash;very well&mdash;but let me see, I had something else to say...&rdquo; He covered his face with his hands and tried to collect his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: &lsquo;I shall never see these people again&mdash;never again! This is the last time I shall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red brick wall of Meyer&rsquo;s house opposite my window.</p></div> </div>
