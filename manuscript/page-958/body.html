It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me tell you that if I hate anyone here&mdash;I hate you all,&rdquo; he cried, in a hoarse, strained voice&mdash;&ldquo;but you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire&mdash;I hate you worse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated you long ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole heart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state! You have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause of my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not want your benefits; I will accept none from anyone;</p></div> </div>
