An unexpected meeting was yet in store for Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p><p>She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road that skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart open carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed some ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Evgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?&rdquo; cried a clear, sweet voice, which caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. &ldquo;Well, I am glad I&rsquo;ve found you at last! I&rsquo;ve sent to town for you twice today myself! My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
