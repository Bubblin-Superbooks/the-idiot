<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, nonsense,&rdquo; said the general, with decision. &ldquo;What extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that&rsquo;s not her way at all. Besides, what could you give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked you for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven&rsquo;t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think so! She&rsquo;s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be prepared!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
