<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you, aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo; began the general, in alarm.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t misunderstand&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I didn&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reject her! I should think not!&rdquo; said the general with annoyance, and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction. How are things going on at home?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
