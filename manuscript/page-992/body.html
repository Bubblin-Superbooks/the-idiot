I remained here last evening, partly because I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue. I enjoyed a discussion over him till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with Lebedeff; and then... then&mdash;I swear by all I hold sacred that I am telling you the truth&mdash;then I wished to develop my soul in this frank and heartfelt confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing myself to sleep at dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in my soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea from hell struck me.</p></div> </div>
