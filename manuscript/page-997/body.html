<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you the truth&mdash;you only! Because you see through a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people. It is always there&mdash;the notion of cheating people, and of using my repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth, prince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh and jeer at me&mdash;but you, you judge a man humanely.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
